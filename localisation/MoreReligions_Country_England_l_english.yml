 ### Events
 mr_england.1.t: "A United Kingdom"
 mr_england.1.d: "England is once again under the total rule of the Crown, seated in in London, under the House of [Root.Monarch.GetDynasty]. Lessons of the Hundred Years Anarchy tell us that too permissive a rule will only cause the country to spiral again into chaos; no more pretender 'kings' or petty lords - only the King. The structure of law will be codified, moving away from common law, and the Church will be reigned in, no longer enjoying its corrupting independence from the State. \n\nIn the Year of Our Lord [GetYear], in the Month of [GetMonth], the King of England, [Root.Monarch.GetName], signed the Statute of Oxford, suspending the need for 'common counsel,' as outlined in the Magna Carta, dissolving English Parliament."
 mr_england.1.a: "A Change in Course"
 mr_absolutist_england_reform: "English Absolutist Monarchy"
 mr_absolutist_england_reform_desc: "The Hundred Years Anarchy was resounding rejection of the efficacy of limited government, only bringing England into turmoil. It is time to take the reigns, bringing the Lords, the People, and the Church to heel."
 
 mr_england.2.t: "King of Ireland"
 mr_england.2.d: "During the Hundred Years Anarchy, the lords of England were split amongst various factions. Those who sided with the Crown and whose assistance was especially helpful were awarded titles for their loyalty. One such case was the Earl of Oxford who, along with autonomy in the heart of England, was granted an additional claim over Ireland as the nominal King of Ireland. Of course, the title was only for prestige and the Earl had little in the way of projecting authority over his claim.\nWith Oxford once again integrated under the English Crown, the title passes to [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]."
 mr_england.2.a: "How curious."
 
 mr_england.2001.t: "Emergence of a New Culture"
 mr_england.2001.d: "The Irish language is a farcry from the native English tounge, but the culture of the people's itself is not far flung from our own back home. Even under Norman Rule, ease of assimilation between our two peoples were easily seen. Perhaps under a long and prosperous rule, the Irish may see themselves becoming more and more similar to English... Or perhaps we must take a more active role in this process."
 mr_england.2001.a: "Delegate lenient oversight."
 mr_england.2001.b: "A more active hand must be taken."
 
 mr_england.2002.t: "Distribution of English Bibles"
 mr_england.2002.d: "The language of the Church is the cornerstone of the educated populace. It is through the Church that the Latin language has continued to persist far after the fall of the Romans. We can follow in the same footsteps, sending Bibles printed in English to Ireland to speed along their assimilation. This may have some larger upfront costs, as the demand for Bibles would practically double overnight as well as the need for educated priests to be sent overseas - but it could be a worthy investment. Additionally, some members of the clergy have expressed worry that this would effectively undermine the existing power of the Clergy, by adding in so many new members."
 mr_england.2002.a: "Money is no object."
 mr_england.2002.b: "Assuage the clergy."
 eng_distribute_english_bibles_TT: "Will make Anglo-Hibernian Conversion events §Y33%§! more likely in provinces with §Gchurches§! or §Gcathederals§!"
 
 mr_england.2003.t: "[Root.GetName] Anglo-Hibernian Majority"
 mr_england.2003.d: "The people of [Root.GetName] live not so different lives from the English of, say, the Midlands or the North - which is to say, by this point they are practically English."
 mr_england.2003.a: "Good news!"
 
 mr_england.2004.t: "The Irish Goods Act"
 mr_england.2004.d: "A great motiviating factor for any conquest are the resources that can be gained from new land. Although it is not rich in mineral wealth, Ireland is a wide and fertile land suitable for all sorts of harvest and grazing. The potential exists for great harvest, but much investment lies ahead."
 mr_england.2004.a: "A stronger economic base for the future."
 mr_england.2004.b: "Domestic goods are more important"
 eng_ire_subsidies_TT: "§YThe Irish Goods Act§! will be removed from this province after it is converted to §YAnglo-Hibernian§!\nWill make Anglo-Hibernian Conversion events §Y25%§! more likely in provinces with over §Y8§! base production"
 
 mr_england.2005.t: "Irish House Lords"
 mr_england.2005.d: "The Gaelic Resurgence empowered many Irish nobles, placing the peerages of Ireland on par with England. Conquest of Ireland was simple, but governing it less so; we cannot do it without the support of the Irish Lords. In [GetYear], The Earl of [irish_house_lord.GetName] journeyed to [Root.Capital.GetName] with an offer: in exchange for promoting the interests of the Crown, he requested a revitalization of his estates and particularlly his castle. He argues that governing from within would be more effective in drawing in the local Irish into our sphere, and would only require a comparitively meager investment."
 mr_england.2005.a: "A compelling proposal."
 mr_england.2005.b: "He's only looking out for himself."
 eng_irish_lords_TT: "Will make Anglo-Hibernian Conversion events §Y25%§! more likely in provinces with §Yforts.§!"
 
 mr_england.2006.t: "Bonding Over the Hunt"
 mr_england.2006.d: "Fox hunts are a time honored tradition for nobility across the British Isles and Ireland. [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] has traveled to [irish_fox_prov.GetName], invited by the local Lord. In the encampment before the Hunt, the two discuss the matters of faith, love, and shared love of the Classics. At first a muted conversation, their talks grew to raucous laughter. Their men outside the main tent, overhearing this, could only take to mirroring their lieges' merriment.\nThe Hunt went off without a hitch, making off with several fox pelts and the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] returning to [Root.Capital.GetName] with a fond memory."
 mr_england.2006.a: "Everyone should give it a go!"
 eng_irish_lords_TT: "Will make Anglo-Hibernian Conversion events §Y10%§! more likely."

 mr_england.2007.d: "[eng_irish_cheese.GetName] has found popularity throughout England, famed for its smooth texture and distinct flavor. Hawkers as far away as Visby have been reported selling [eng_irish_cheese.GetName] Cheese. At home, it has quickly found a foothold amongst other English cheese varieties."
 mr_england.2007.a: "Get me more!"
 eng_irish_cheese_TT: "Will make Anglo-Hibernian Conversion events §Y5%§! more likely."
 
 mr_england.2008.t: "Survey of [Root.GetName]"
 mr_england.2008.d: "Conquered lands are nothing without the people who inhabit it. To make any use of a newly integrated provicne, one must properly survey its homesteads and farms so that they may be taxed properly. We arrive in [Root.GetName] to find population of [Root.GetCapitalName] has grown noticably since the last records from several years ago seem to suggest."
 mr_england.2008.a: "Count them carefully!"

 eng_irish_census_TT: "Will make Anglo-Hibernian Conversion events §Y10%§! more likely §Yin this province§!."
 
 mr_england.2009.t: "William Seanlaoich"
 mr_england.2009.d: "Born to Irish father John and English mother Mary in a village on the outskirts of Dublin, William Seanlaoich's early life is sparesly recorded, with scant documents only revealing an education in Latin and Greek - not unusual of grammar school attendants. Regardless of his upbringing, much of his known life comes after his first breakout play in London. As playwright, his theatrical productions quickly gained fame throughout London, and then England. His work is often cited as the origin of several Irish loanwords popularized and brought into the English language which persevere even today: ciotóg, craic, and moran, to name a few. Today, even those unfamiliar with theater and poetry will likely know 'Dream of a Midsummer Night,' 'Alexander,' and 'The Merchant of Genoa.'"
 mr_england.2009.a: "I'm looking forward to the next one!"
 
 mr_england.2010.t: "Plantation of [This.GetName]"
 mr_england.2010.d: "Although the ruling class has been supplanted with thoroughly Anglicized Irish, the general populace is still native of great number and evermore disatisfied with the tight grasp on the island. The Plantation Scheme was devised by Crown advisors to completely pacify Ireland and simultaneously extract all the wealth it could from the land and its people."
 mr_england.2010.a: "Let private merchants handle it."
 mr_england.2010.b: "Administer order directly."
 mr_england.2010.c: "Enact unfulfillable contracts of servitude."
 
 mr_england.3.t: "Two Islands, One State"
 mr_england.3.d: "Since the conquest of Ireland, the people of have quickly taken to adopting the English language, followed closely by adopting many of the cultural practices of people in England proper. Reports have even gone so far as to call the people of Dublin 'More English than the English themselves,' despite it being the premier center of Irish culture only decades before. With the impetus of conquering Ireland being uniting both Kingdoms under the same crown, it would not be unreasonable to finally officialize this permanent union of crowns into one."

 mr_england.5.t: "Founding of the Crown Navy"
 mr_england.5.d: "[Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] has seen it necessary to create a standing navy in order maintain our mercantile interests in the region. The oppurtunistic landgrab of Wight by the North Sea League was not the only oppurtunity by foreign powers to intervene in England; there was also foreign support of the Yorkish pretender, as well as raids from disunited France. With the consolidation of merchant fleets and the remaning warships under the command of the Crown, the Crown Navy has had its first officer and first Lord Admiral commissioned."
 mr_england.5.a: "First Lord Admiral, Thomas Beaufort, Earl of Somerset"
 mr_england.5.b: "First Lord Admiral, William Percy, Earl of Kent"
 mr_england.5.c: "First Lord Admiral, Richard Holland, Duker of Bedford"
 
 mr_england.6.t: "On the Wycliffites"
 mr_england.6.d: "John Wycliffe's teachings spread far and wide during the Anarchy, allowing the practice of Wycliffite to spread unabated. With the restablishment of the King's authority, it was best to stamp out these heretics, as their existence could have been seen as tolerance by the Church and would be a direct reflection of the lack of authority of the King.\nOur efforts to actively deal with this heresy have awarded us great favor with the Church."
 mr_england.6.a: "Good deal."

 mr_england.8.t: "Statutes of Iona"
 mr_england.8.d: "On the island of Iona, the representatives of the Clans of the Scottish Highlands convened with a delegation of the Crown. The weak presence of feudal peerages and dominance of the Clann system will prove to be a challenge for the Crown, given nothing is done to ease them into the Kingdom. After several days of discussion, the Crown delegates discuss amongst themselves the two options they've settled on: education of heirs in English, as well as the introduction of English into clerical life - among other methods - in an effort for longterm, but stable integration; or a more heavy handed approach of banning Gaelic and other Scottish traditions - the downsides of which are apparent."
 mr_england.8.a: "We should institue longterm policies for assimilating the Clans."

 eng_m_scotland_path2_TT: "Unlock §YConquest of the Scots§! path."
 
 mr_england.9.t: "Decline of the [Root.GetName] Royal Forest"
 mr_england.9.d: "First enacted by William the Conqueror, Forest Law has existed within England as a means of game preservation. Since then, Forest Law has evolved through various addendums and the Magna Carta itself, but altogether steadily declining in importance.  This is especially apparent now, as recent surveys through [Root.GetName] reveal that the overcutting has made large swathes barren - likely felled to create and repair the Crown Navy."
 mr_england.9.a: "The trees will regrow..."
 
 mr_england.9002.t: "Severe Exhaustion the [Root.GetName] Royal Forest"
 mr_england.9002.d: "The [Root.GetName] Royal Forest has been reduced to a shadow of its former self. Where once were throngs of game are now reduced to a quiet rustle here and there. Birds chirp and hares run - evidence that the forest still lives; but only so."
 mr_england.9002.a: "It is not too late to do something about it..."
 
 mr_england.9003.t: "Restoration of the [Root.GetName] Royal Forest"
 mr_england.9003.d: "With an effort initiated by past generation, and with lessons passed down, the efforts to preserve [Root.GetName] Royal Forest have paid off. Future lumber extraction will be done with care and not without replacing each cut tree with two more saplings in kind."
 mr_england.9003.a: "A wonderful sight!"

Various ideas were floated, ranging from deals with the nobility, contracts with merchants, and expanding taxation systems in less counties, but it was these two that they settled on."

 mr_england.1002.b: "Good news for administration."
 
 mr_england.1003.t: "Migration From the Hinterlands"
 mr_england.1003.d: "No great empire has ever held a tight grasp on all of her lands. Most of the territories are often delegated to subordinate governors and dukes and the like. Nominal contributions become paltry tribute by the time they arrive to the capital. With only a little encouragement, we've managed to attract migrants to the core territories of [Root.GetName]."

 mr_england.102.d: "Chartering the lumberyards were a great boon for the continued existence of a robust shipbuilding industry. But even the great mills we have now are not meant to fuel the greatest extent of our ambitions.\n\nA call to the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] by a Crown Navy Minister was a few years ago made urging the Crown to be proactive in securing future sources of lumber. With the trajectory of the nation, it took little foresight to start."

 mr_england.10.d: "John Capgrave was a historian and theologian. He is known for documenting the lives of saints, and created the first collection of the lives of English Saints after returning from a visit to Rome. He is currently in the midsts of recounting a history of England, especially during the Hundred Years Anarchy, though the many documents and lives lost during the ordeal are not making it easy."

 mr_england.11.d: "Under the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName], Fortescue served as Justice of the Crown. During his tenure, he also penned 'The Laws of the Kingdom of England,' an impressive text which served as the cornerstone of codified English Law as the Kingdom transitioned away from common law."
 mr_england.11.a: "We need more like him."
 
 mr_england.12.t: "William Caxton"
 mr_england.12.d: "As a trader making regular trips between the North Sea League cities, William Caxton was the first known Englishman to have taken an interest in the newly emerging technology of presses. It was after a return trip from Amsterdam that he recounted the usefulness of the press for diseminating thought - likely a contributing factor for the independently-minded Dutch. Caxton quickly assembled the first press in England; his first print, a copy of Chaucer's Tales of Canterbury."
 mr_england.12.a: "Interesting."

 mr_england.13.d: "First Lord Boyd of Scotland was knighted by [SCO.Monarch.GetTitle] [SCO.Monarch.GetName] for his exceptional statecraft.

 mr_england.15.t: "Richard Neville, Earl of Warwick"
 mr_england.15.d: "The House of Neville descends from an old family in the north of England. During the Hundred Years Anarchy, the family rose to prominence eventually seizing control of the English throne. A nephew of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName], Richard Neville gained some noteriety as a young man in the final years of the Anarchy, and was subsequently awarded a position as Captain of Calais. The position was highly regarded and sought after because of the office's role in designating tariffs and trade from the mainland through the port."
 mr_england.15.a: "We should recall him for military service."
 mr_england.15.b: "He should keep his post."
 
 mr_england.16.t: "William Warham"
 mr_england.16.d: "Bishop of London, William Warham, has made quite the name for himself. He is well known among clerical circles for his rivalry with other bishops in England. His position in London has insulated him from much recourse, but the choice to keep him emplaced is ultimately the decision of the Crown. Unfortunately the politics of the Church all but guarantee that ousting him from London would see him promoted to Archbishop if recalled to Canterbury."
 mr_england.16.a: "Keep him close."
 MR_BISHOP_OF_LONDON_OUSTED: "Bishop of London Ousted"
 
 mr_england.17.t: "Edward Poyning"
 mr_england.17.d: "Sir Edward Poynings was a commissioner serving under the Crown in Calais. During his service, he kept the coasts of Calais free of piracy and was even called upon by local Low Countries leaders to help defend against Church incursions against the native heresies. Although the Crown was releuctant to award him, lest they bring the ire of the Church upon them, his accolades were impossible to ignore. He was knighted in 1489, but recalled to help administer the recently conquered Irish. His commission over Ireland is remembered as effecient but tyrannical, dismantling the former diarchial parliament, and replacing it with institutions of the English Crown."
 mr_england.17.a: "Results are all that matters."
 
 mr_england.18.t: "Thomas Howard"
 mr_england.18.d: "Born into the lineage for Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Howard lived a typical nobleman's life until he gained distinction in the conquest of Scotland. For his achievements in the field, he was awarded the distinction of the Knight of the Garter and climbing the ladder found himself a spot on the Crown Privy Council. He served in multiple capacities: Lord Treasurer, Deputy of Ireland, and Lord Admiral, though not always at the same time."
 mr_england.18.a: "We need our finances straightened out."
 mr_england.18.b: "A new deputy is needed in Ireland."
 mr_england.18.c: "A new admiral is needed for our growing navy."
 
 mr_england.19.t: "Thomas Wolsey"
 mr_england.19.d1: "Thomas Wolsey was a Catholic bishop highly involved in English politics. He was appointed as Archbishop of York in 1514, giving him presedence over a majority of the English clergy. This level of influence put him next to the King, often allowing him to provide direct advise not only in matters of faith, but also statescraft. One would be right to be wary of such unilaterally given advice, but his words led often to visible results; revisions on taxation, the justice system, monastic organization, even overseas diplomacy to name a few successes."
 mr_england.19.d2: "Even among the horizontal hierarchy of the Wycliffe Church, Thomas Wolsey stood out amongst the rest; his ability to preach and careful, diplomatic demeanour put him at the front - not top - of the clergy. Originally gaining fame in York, his calculating words extended his reach all the way to London as he became an advisor of sorts to several English nobles. Eventually, he was requested for an audience with the Crown Privy Council and the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] himself."
 mr_england.19.a: "Heed his advice."
 mr_england.19.b: "Heed his advice."
 
 mr_england.20.t: "Thomas More"
 mr_england.20.d1: "Thomas More was born in London and studied at Oxford under a classical education where he became incredibly profecient in both Greek and Latin; it is said he is as fluent in Latin as his native tounge. After University he served as a lawyer, quickly gaining infamy in representing nobles against the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. He was also very outspoken against the various new heretical movements founded by Luther and Zwingli. Despite these, he remained steadfast in faith and law. In 1516, he published the now famous political treatise 'Utopia,' a socio-political satire on the ideal state."
 mr_england.20.d2: "Thomas More was born in London and studied at Oxford under a classical education where he became incredibly profecient in both Greek and Latin; it is said he is as fluent in Latin as his native tounge. After University he opted to become a monk, invited to Rotterdam by his good friend Erasmus. During his time in Holland he became increasingly more interested with the local Brethren's practices and the new theological debates opened by Luther and Zwingli. Despite his desire to adopt a monastic life, he felt it necessary to carry his learnings with him back to the Wycliffe clerics in England. His seminal work, 'Nusquama' envisioned a utopian island with strict adhereance to Papal edict; a cursory read reveals it to be a thinly veiled crticism on the ills of the Church as it imagines Catholic Doctrine taken to the extreme."
 mr_england.20.a: "Sounds like an interesting read."
 mr_england.20.b: "Sounds like an interesting read."
 
 mr_england.21.t: "William Tyndale"
 mr_england.21.d: "As the Protestant Reformation swept through Europe, the question of translated Bibles was often brought to the forefront. Why should the Bible only be able for the educated few, schooled in Latin? William Tyndale, a biblical scholar and linguist, took his request first to English Church leaders where he was promptly rejected. Fleeing to Germany, he found that the Archbishop of Cologne would sponsor his request, eventually securing approval from the Pope himself."
 mr_england.21.a: "Straight to the presses!"
 mr_england.21.b: "We cannot also approve."
 
 mr_england.22.t: "Thomas Cromwell's Religious Reforms"
 mr_england.22.d: "During the British Reformation, Thomas Cromwell was a massive proponent for several anti-papist reforms. He started as a lowly statesman, climbing the ranks until he was seated on the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s Privy Council. Much of the work he is remembered for revolves around breaking religious doctrine with Rome; he is responsible for dissolving the monasteries around Britain, disbanding most of the monastic orders as well as some somewhat iconoclastic practices of dismantling and destroying 'idolatrous' statues, screens, and images."
 mr_england.22.a: "He has the right idea!"
 mr_england.22.b: "He is overstepping! It is my decision!"
 
 mr_england.23.t: "Thomas Cranmer's Religious Reforms"
 mr_england.23.d: "The British Reformation brought to the forefront many religious leaders and thinkers, who each wanted their own say on the seperation of Britain from Rome. Thomas Cranmer was once such figure; as the Archbishop of Canterbury, he pushed heavily for the primacy of the Crown. One of his lasting legacies was the publication of the Book of Common Prayer, a prayer book written in English."
 mr_england.23.a: "Publish and distribute it."
 mr_england.23.a: "We have other things to worry about."
 
 mr_england.24.t: "William Paulet, 1st Marquess of Winchester"
 mr_england.24.d: "William Paulet served as a statement in over a dozen or so different capacities, leading a long career in the service of the Crown. From being sheriff, steward, governor, and even sitting on the Privy Council, Paulet navigated a the tumultuous period that was the British Reformation with ease. When asked how he managed, he responded with 'By being a willow, not an oak.'"

 mr_england.25.t: "Maghnus Ó Domhnaill"
 mr_england.25.d: "During the Irish Golden Age, Maghnus Ó Domhnaill worked to settle the differences between his own, and the O'Neil Clan. The small spat during the Golden Age could have easily spiralled out of control were it not for his even temperment and cool head. Later in his life he dictated a biography of a saint in 'Life of Saint Columbkille' in the Irish language. He continued to be a poet till his death, where many of his poems - in Irish - survive today."
 mr_england.25.a: "A writer to remember."
 
 mr_england.26.t: "William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley"
 mr_england.26.d: "William Cecil served on the Privy Council of [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName], offering advice on both domestic politics and economic policy during different roles. He advocated heavily for the continued centralization of the British Isles under a [Root.Religion.GetName] state."
 mr_england.26.a: "We should listen to political suggestions."
 mr_england.26.b: "We should listen to his economic suggestions."
 
 mr_england.27.t: "Thomas Butler, 10th Earl of Ormond"
 mr_england.27.d: "Butler was born in Ireland, and after becoming of age, he quickly became absorbed into the various internal and external conflicts of the land. He spent much of tenure dealing with the Earls of Desmond, who had a long-standing feud with his own House. He eventually ascended to the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s Privy Council on matters of Ireland, being recognized for his successes in putting down several rebellions."
 mr_england.27.a: "" 
 
 mr_england.28.t: "William Byrd"
 mr_england.28.d: "William Byrd comes from a wealthy family from Essex. Little is known about his early life besides that he began to first practice music professionally at Lincoln Cathedearl in 1563, at the age of 23. Although he grew to become a very devout Catholic, it did not stop him from contributing to Protestant church's musical traditions as well. From his youth to his late years he saw steady growth, eventually becoming one of the most prolific composers in Britain, creating hundreds of pieces before his death. "
 mr_england.28.a: "Beautiful!"
 
 mr_england.29.t: "John Hawkins"
 mr_england.29.d: "John Hawkins served on the Privy Council of [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName], and was responsible for a significant expansion of the Crown Navy as well as improving its day to day operations, owing to his and his familiy's background in shipbuilding at Plymouth. Hawkins not only served in the highest official capacity as a Privy Council Advisor, but also as a commander, privateer, and slaver."
