 mr_ireland.1.t: "Resotring Universitas Dubliniensis"
 mr_ireland.1.d: "Universitas Dubliniensis was founded in 1320, under Papal brief. During this time Ireland was in the midst of shaky but ultimately prosperous formation of the current diarchy. Unfortunately, the Archbishop tasked with maintaining it siphoned funds and taxes meant for the institution leaving only a basic shell of what the University meant to be. Now that the dust has settled and the former Archbishop has been replaced, we can take some time to restore it."
 mr_ireland.1.a: "It's only a matter of sorting out papers."
 mr_ireland.1.b: "There's no point."
