 mr_catholic.19.t: "Reconstructionist Opposition Consolidates"
 mr_catholic.19.d: "From the outside, the Reconstructionist block is seemingly united in their demands: The Catholic Church must both return to form, destroy and rebuild the corrupt clergy, and squash the heretics. While they grow in influence, the opposition has done little but bicker and act in self-interest - business as usual for most of them.\n\nSurprisingly, a respectable group has found each other, lead by a cardinal from [guy_who_formed_status_quo_faction.GetName]. They claim that they wish to reform the Church from within, wresting the levers of corruption away from those who abuse it most. In turn, they hope that newfound stability will reorient the powers of the Church back to its rightful place. With support from the Pope, even a weak one, they might even have a chance."

 mr_catholic.21.t: "Limitations on Beneficium"
 mr_catholic.21.d: "Benefice was a payment given to Church offices for their 'work.' Under the current state of the Catholic Church, with the completely unchecked rule from Church offices, taxation has risen across Europe, most notably within the confines of more zealous bishops. This of course, has begun to cut into crown taxation, which in turn has brought the Church under fire from monarchs across Europe.\n\nSeveral Priest-Cardinals had drafted a proposition for approval by the Pope [PAP.Monarch.GetName] in hopes that placing limitations on these beneficium would keep the crowns of Europe from siding with the Reconstructionist faction."

Cardinals, bishops, abboots, and other clergymen from all over Europe have gathered to a discuss a unified trajectory of the Church.\nThe first conclave only saw unresolved debate, with Reconstructionists only reiterating their position: that the wanton corruption of the Church would only undermine its longterm authority. The conclave ended inconclusively."
