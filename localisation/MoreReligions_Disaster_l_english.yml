#Ilkhanate Disaster
 ilkhanate_disaster: "Anarchy of Iranzamin"
 desc_ilkhanate_disaster: "The political and religious disunity is causing the Ilkhanate state to come to a bloody and violent end."
 ilkhanate_flavor.1.t: "The Safavid Revolt"
 ilkhanate_flavor.1.d: "In the heart of the Azerbaijan region lies the Safavid order, a group of Shiite practitioners who follow a unique set of religious laws passed down by their Imams of the Safavid Clan. While they were tolerated by the Ilkhanate, the Iranian Intermezzo has caused enough turbulence for them to seize the opportunity for a revolt."
 ilkhanate_flavor.1.a: "We must strike down the traitors!"
 ilkhanate_flavor.1.b: "The Rise of the Safaviyya cannot be stopped!"
 ilkhanate_flavor.10.t: "The Anarchy of Tabriz"
 ilkhanate_flavor.10.d: "The Ilkhanate, founded in 1256, was a political and economic powerhouse in the former Mongol Empire. While the rest of the Empire collapsed into civil war and chaos, the Ilkhanate remained strong in the highlands of Persia, with the capital in Tabriz becoming home to wealth and power hitherto unseen. However, a darkness lurked beneath the curtain that the Ilkhanate had so carefully woven, one which threatened to grow and overtake the powerful state. The House of Hulagu had captured the Abbasid Caliph during the siege of Baghdad, and by granting them vast swaths of autonomy, they secured the loyalty of the caliphs to come, granting them Autonomy and authority over their Sunni realm, while at the same time allowing Sufi and radical sects to exist in moderation.\n\nHowever, the era of peace and tolerance has ended. Across the country, fury against the Sunni leadership has radicalized around various messianic figures, who now actively call for open rebellion. Ironically, at the same time, various Sunni leaders are also decrying the tolerance that these Sufis have been given. The Iranzamin realm is breaking apart at the seams, and it appears it might not be able to weather the coming storm..."

 ilkhanate_flavor.9.t: "Warlords in the South"
 ilkhanate_flavor.9.d: "In the southern Fars, Lusristan, and Kerman regions, local warlords have conquered barrackses and castles. They have seized armories and proclaimed themselves "true" masters of the regions, and are actively rejecting the authority of the Ilkhan! They say that our inability to manage the south has forced them to take drastic measures in defending their realms, but in truth it is nothing but a farce to gain power while their masters are weak!"
 ilkhanate_flavor.9.a: "We must regain control quickly!"

 HUN_flavor.2.t: "The Looming Hungarian Crisis"
 HUN_flavor.2.d: "In the year 1302 the King of Hungary, Andrew III, died from poor health in the great city of Buda, ending the house of Arpad once and for all. His strife with the great oligarchs of Hungary had left the kingdom fractured and disunited. Charles the I, the supposed rightful heir, had caught the Plague and died, but it was for naught either way. Many Hungarian nobles did not want the young boy to come to power. Instead the oligarchs invited Ladislaus V to rule their land - and while this united the lands of Hungary and Bohemia for a time, the king kept trying to force the Hungarian nobles to bend to his will and join the Empire, something the Hungarians had no desire to do.\n\nThe King had strife with the houses of Poland, and when he launched an invasion on the emperor himself, the houses of Aba, Kan, Czak, and Koszegi rose up in revolt and instead gave the rule to a Hungarian Nobleman by the name of Thomas Szécsényi, who was instrumental in overthrowing the Bohemian forces. The Szécsényi did not get to power alone, however - they appealed to the Polish crown and the Serbian lords, calling upon their aid to overthrow the Bohemian ownership. While Thomas died in 1332 while pushing out the Bohemian influence, his son Michael became the King of Hungary at the age of 15.\n\nAfter being placed on the throne, any attempts at centralization were crushed by the Oligarchs. Instead, a decentralized era began, where each oligarch had immense control over their own territory - during this time, the Serbians and Poles shifted their focus away from the Szécsényi and instead towards the Koszegis and Aba as potential allies respectively, as the Szécsényi seemed paradoxically too proud to be useful puppets but too weak to be effective at controlling Hungary. In the year 1444, Michael's heir Nicholas rules a fragmenting and broken Hungary, and wishes to unite the land - should he do so, the Kingdom will fragment and fracture into the Oligarchs, all vying for control and power..."
 HUN_flavor.2a: "The Hungarian realm hangs by a thread..."
 HUN_flavor.1.t: "The Crumbling of Hungary"
 HUN_flavor.1.d: "Hungary has fallen into chaos. King Nicholas Szécsényi has long since wanted to curb the power of the oligarchs of Hungary, yet every time he attempted to do so, they would rebuke and threaten war. Ever arrogant, Nicholas assumed this was merely a bluff, that they would not really threaten their realm with such an action. After King Nicholas had presented a series of reforms to centralize the kingdom to the Hungarian parliament, however, the Oligarchs of Hungary rose up to overthrow the lord who challenged their power. Backed by various foreign powers, the lands of the Pannonian basin have been turned into a battleground of kings and lords, all wanting to seize the Holy Crown of Hungary."

 HUN_flavor.4.t: "Oligarchs Request Support"
 HUN_flavor.4.d: "The Oligarchs of Hungary, who have been our allies since the crisis began nearly a century prior, now call for support. The fighting grows fiercer everyday, as the oligarchs tear each other apart with sword and spear alike. We were in the quagmire that was this conflict not 50 years prior, and our people and soldiers do not wish to so readily join another war. While the diplomats sent by these oligarchs are not so bold as to request we join them in the battlefield immediately, they do request that we send monetary support and men to fill their ranks."
