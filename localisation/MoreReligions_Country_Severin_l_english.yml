 JAA_ideas_start: "Severiner Traditions"

 JAA_first: "Brothers in Faith"
 JAA_first_desc: "Back when our order was first established, our mission was clear, to care for the sick, poor, or injured pilgrims to the Holy Land. Over time, that goal became corrupted, turning us into yet another military order with our hospital duties playing second fiddle. After the fall of Jerusalem, a group of knights blamed the failure on the order's corrupt nature and preferential treatment only to Catholic pilgrims, citing that all Christians irregardless of which Apostolic successor they bowed to in the mortal world, for they all bowed to God in the end. We are the successors of that group, having been exiled by our own kind in the Outremer for our justness. Through this, we've garnered a stronger bond with the locals who bolster our ranks, looking out for eachother in battle."

 JAA_second: "Connecting the Settlements"
 JAA_second_desc: "When the Hungarian kings invited us to Oltenia on the 2nd of June, 1247, we were initially hesistant at first, for our hearts were still longing for the holy land. What we found here was a land ravaged by countless invasions of nomads past, but also a tenacious population that throughout all of that had scattered holdouts. If we are to make our new home prosper, we should encourage the people to come out of hiding. To that end, several construction projects are to be had, and thanks to the many ruins already in place we might just have an easier task ahead."

 JAA_third: "The Severin Tower"
 JAA_third_desc: "We are the hosts of the Severin Citadel, a fortification with a tradition long predating even our own order. Its latest iteration having being made under the Hungarian kings back in the 11th century, reconstructed on what remained on the fortification built by the Romans across the migration period from the destruction of the original castrum by the Huns up till being lost to the Bulgars, with its prevalent feature being its imposing towers, especially the one in the middle. Said feature has endured even to this day, giving the fortification the name of §YTurnu Severin§!, "Tower of Severus", now this Severus being either the Roman emperor or the saint of Noricum who the Hungarians dedicated its Church being lost to time. Irregardless of the name's origin, the strong and imposing tower allows us to have much deeper stockpiles, garrison quarters and utilies, allowing us to host a larger garrison that will be able to repell any besiegers more effectively."

 JAA_fourth: "Torch of Civilisation"
 JAA_fourth_desc: "Being at the edge between the civilised world and the savagery of the many coming and going hordes of the steppes, we've taken great pride in being the torchbearers of the proper way of life in these wild lands. Using the connections with our western brothers, we are able to keep up with the ever so advancing whims of time and the needs of a state to function properly in modern times. We shall be a shining example for all the world, and thrive throughout the ages, improving ourselves through ourselves."

 JAA_fifth: "Monastic Schools"
 JAA_fifth_desc: "One of our many duties is to illuminate the way with the bright flames of innovation that come from the great minds all across the world. By supporting the monasteries dotted across the land in their more academic endevours, it might just result in helping the spread, or even sparking, of innovative ideas. After all, God gave us this world to tame, and what helps better with that than to understand it and its inhabitants better?"

 JAA_sixth: "Restructured Taxation System"
 JAA_sixth_desc: "Our old feudal taxation system is crippled with horrible inneficiencies, everly undiligent collectors, a lack of census to determine what we should expect from each region, and even a separation of the legally required revenue between the different Languages, and many more such particular additions result in a terrible loss of revenue. If we are to take a look at all these exceptions that have been piling up over the years and do a complete make over of the system it should prove most valueable."

 JAA_seventh: "Bridge Between Worlds"
 JAA_seventh_desc: "We are at the crossroads between the Catholic and the Orthodox world, with our lands being where the two meet. With this, we've come to understand that each world has its own mannerisms, its own special ways to talk, to move, to address others and even to simply sit and listen. By using this to our advantage, we can forge a reputation of most honourable guests and hosts, making it far easier to find, and even maintain, partners on the world stage."
