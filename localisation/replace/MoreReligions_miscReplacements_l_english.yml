 renaissance: "Bureaucracy"
 desc_renaissance: "The administration of a vast realm has been a challenge since ancient times, with rulers often delegating portions to other subordinate administrators. The modernization of this, with the adoption of signed or marked documents, law standardization, proper changes to recordkeeping, and all the paperwork machniations that go with it are key to effeciently manage our domain."

 enlightenment: "Political Ideology"
 desc_enlightenment: "Since the wide adoption of the printing press, dissemination of ideas and thoughts have accelerated at an unbelievable rate. No longer are thinkers' audiences limited to their immediate circle; their thoughts can be read and debated across the seas and countrysides. A common style of writing is or particular interest to any ruler, this concept of 'Ideology,' a set of ideas, derived from morals, or religions, or economies, or a combination thereof, from which political thought is synthesized. Could this be a stabilizing force? One for Good? Time will tell."
