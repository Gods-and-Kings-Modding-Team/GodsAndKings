We are expected to pick up the mantle of the Emperor and bring the Chinese people into a new era of prosperity and stability.\nIf we want to win over the remaining supporters of the former dynasty's rule we must start to build our own Imperial bureaucracy and invest in a strong and durable state.

But since it is impossible to know who is predestined, a notion has developed that it might be possible to discern that a person is predestined by observing their way of life. As hard work, frugality, social success and wealth are thought to be important consequences of being predestined, it seems to inspire followers of the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith to strive for reaching them, as well as attracting those who already possess them - like burghers and merchants."

prices.37.t:0 "Bakirian Exchange"
 prices.37.d:0 "With the colonization of the Reislands a wide range of new seeds, crops and animals are starting to spread between the New World and the old. From the first moment of introduction crops such as maize, manioc and tomatoes are now spreading over the entire old world, just as Non-American beasts of burden are becoming ever-more sought after in the new world.\nAs lands that were once considered unfit for growing anything, either for part of the year or in some cases ever before, are put to use in the production of food and cereals, the general availability of food in the world is higher than ever before. Few things in this century will bring as much benefit to the common man, as grown food is now much less scarce than it once was."
