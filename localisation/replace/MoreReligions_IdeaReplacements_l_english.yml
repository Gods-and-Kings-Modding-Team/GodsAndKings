 JAP_ideas_MR_start: "Japanese Traditions"
 JAP_ideas_MR_bonus: "Japanese Ambition"
 mr_jap_unification_under_the_emperor: "The Kenmu Restoration"
 mr_jap_unification_under_the_emperor_desc: "In the aftermath of the fall of the Kamakura Shogunate at the hands of the Nitta Yoshisada and emperor Go-Daigo, the country had finally, after nearly 200 years of military rule, fallen back into the emperor's control. The emperor is the sovereign of all the islands of Japan, and despite the attempts by various clans and samurai to overthrow him, the house of Yamato stands strong against all pretenders."
 mr_reformed_land_holding: "Go-Kameyama Reforms"
 mr_reformed_land_holding_desc: "At the turn of the 15th Century, emperor Go-Daigo's dreams of reforming the land distribution systems of Japan were still far off from being completed. He wished to pull control away from the Shugo, centralizing authority from within the state as was the case in the Chen-Han Dynasty to the west. However, this dream would not be seen until the rise of emperor Go-Kameyama, who secured an alliance with the Nitta clan through a marriage and pushed through his reforms at a national level. Now, the Emperor can not only rule the land more effectively, but he may also quickly summon his soldiers from their homes should the need arise."
 mr_jap_modernization: "Cheng–Zhu Teachings"
 mr_jap_modernization_desc: "Neo-Confucianism teaches a rationalist, academic truth to the world, that one must explore the world in an observationalist way. While it initially remained within the mountain temples during the Kamakura era, emperor Go-Murakami was the first to incorporate aspects of this school into the governance of the country. He encouraged learning, reasoning, and scientific advancements through various places of learning which he sponsored and patroned, such as the Ashikaga Gakko."
 mr_jap_land_of_the_rising_sun: "Shinbutsu-Shugo"
 mr_jap_land_of_the_rising_sun_desc: "Japan is a land of Kami and Buddhas, of monks and priests, of temples and shrines. The Buddhist traditions that arose and developed here have intermingled and conjoined with the native traditions of the Kami, tying our past with our ever developing future. While the two are not always perfectly aligned, the people of Japan follow both the path of the dharma and the worship of nature."
 mr_jap_shogun_legacy: "Legacy of the Shogunate"
 mr_jap_shogun_legacy_desc: "While the shogun was defeated and pushed away, the samurai still remain a powerful force in our political climate. We cannot simply ignore them; we shall do as Go-Daigo did, and work to integrate them to become loyal subjects once more. They are, after all, incredibly wise and talented warriors, so it would only make sense to conjoin them with our state."

 POR_ideas: "Portugal Ideas"
 POR_ideas_start: "Portuguese Traditions"
 POR_ideas_bonus: "Portuguese Ambitions"
 legacy_of_the_conqueror_desc: "Our first king, the glorious Dom Afonso Henriques the conqueror, set the path for us to follow. A path of divine holy war against all heathens and heretics and so we shall not rest until the cross has dominion over all."
 legacy_of_the_conqueror: "Legacy of the Conqueror"
 pure_blood_lusitanian_desc: "We are blessed by God, for within our lands dwells the pure bred lusitanian horse. One of the fastest breeds known to man and one whose usage even dates all the way to the Roman Hipodrome. We shall make use of this breed within our armies, for none then shall be able to escape from our knights."
 pure_blood_lusitanian: "Pure blooded Lusitanians"
 never_ending_reconquista_desc: "It will never be over, the reconquista shall extend far beyond the borders of Iberia. We shall march into Africa, into the Holy Land, into Persia and even into Cathay itself! We see now, we can only truly rest once every soul truly embraces the love of Christ only then shall we truly have salvation."
 never_ending_reconquista: "The never ending reconquista"
 faith_before_land_desc: "Our brave soldiers do not fear death, for every faithful soul that dwells in Portugal knows our earthly struggle against the forces of evil shall be rewarded with eternal salvation and a welcome in paradise. Avante!"
 faith_before_land: "Faith before land"
 the_cavaleiros_desc: "No other element of our holy army is as distinguished as glorious, as our Cavaleiros. Our brave mounted troops, already our people see them as heros and models to follow. We shall elevate them and make the Cavaleiros and their charges against the forces of hell the centerpiece of our entire culture and society, let our enemies tremble against the charge of our brave Knights."
 the_cavaleiros: "The Cavaleiros"
 christian_fanaticism_desc: "We swear ourselves to Christ, let every man, woman and child in Portugal know that we demand nothing but absolute dedication to our cause and to our faith. If any dare go against it, they shall be punished and judged by God for their insolence."
 christian_fanaticism: "Christian Fanaticism"
 gloria_a_Deus_nas_alturas_desc: "Glory to God almighty. Lord protect us as we struggle against your enemies, grant us salvation upon our sacrifice and iluminate our leaders with your divine wisdom so that we can make thy will a reality"

 GAL_ideas: "Galician Ideas"
 GAL_ideas_start: "Galician Traditions"
 GAL_ideas_bonus: "Galician Ambitions"
 gal_the_cross_and_hammer_desc: "The realm of Galicia has once again achieved independence. While the kingdoms of Leon and Castile battle one another for Iberian supremacy, the free peasants and wealthy burgos urged the bishop of Santiago de Compostela to sieze the moment and once more declare independence. For now we have been sucessful and our realm is made up and ruled by the combined powers of the Cross, the clergy and bishop, and the Hammer, the urban burgos and rural free peasantry."
 gal_the_cross_and_hammer: "By Cross and Hammer"
 gal_the_burgos_desc: "The burgos are the rich urban dwelling class that inhabit all of our cities. Their origins date back to the establishment of the autonomous villages and cities that awnsered directly to the King of Leon. In the years since, the burgos have increased in power, influence and wealth, so much so that they now dwarf even that of the nobility and have become on par with the wealth of the church. We have an understanding with the Burgos, as long as we respect their autonomy and freedom in part, the burgos will provide us with the funds and power needed to maintain our influence and independence from the rest of the Iberian crowns."
 gal_the_burgos: "The Burgos"
 gal_foreign_pilgrims_desc: "Santiago de Compostela remains one of the most popular destinations for Pilgrims from all across christendom, and where there is a pious pilgrim, is a coin purse waiting to be emptied. We must increase the proffits we can extract from the pilgrims, either by directly taxing their passage through the Camino de Santiago, or through encouraging the selling of useless Burgo and Peasant made knick-knacks to the Pilgrims so that they may always remeber their profitable- err, pious journey to Galicia."
 gal_foreign_pilgrims: "Foreign Pilgrims with Foreign Gold"
 gal_volunteer_militias_desc: "One of the conditions imposed on the bishop by the burgos, is that we are not allowed to muster an army of our own. Instead the defense of Galicia is left up to the various independent and autonomous communities. All we are allowed to do is to call upon these volunteer militias and warn them in case of war. But as to where to direct them, and how to lead them that is up to the Burgo leaders."
 gal_volunteer_militias: "Autonomous Volunteer Militias"
 gal_foreign_markets_desc: "The wealth that the church can capture, and that the burgos can craft is great sure, but Galicia is small and the world is vast with endless oportunities for fortune. We shall encourage and send merchants to faraway markets and bring exotic trade goods back into Galicia, propelling our shared wealth even further."
 gal_foreign_markets: "Adventures into Foreign Markets"
 gal_compete_with_basque_whalers_desc: "Our eastern neighbors in Navarra have grown wealthy, even exceddingly so from their whaling ventures. The burgos and the bishop look at this wealth with envy, we must not be outdone in commercial pursuits by the Basque! Man the boats and sharpen the harpoons, we too shall catch that golden whale."
 gal_compete_with_basque_whalers: "Compete with the Basque whalers"
 gal_abolish_serfdom_desc: "The Burgos have grown exceddingly powerful, nothing now can stop them from claiming total control over Galicia. We are completely at their mercy and so, we shall offer one last concession in the hopes of retaining at least our ceremonial position. We shall abolish serfdom in the entire land of Galicia, from this point on every man in Galicia is free to live as they choose without having to awnser to any lord. May God help us."
 gal_abolish_serfdom: "Abolish Serfdom"

 mines_of_takedda_desc: "The copper that flows from the mines of Takedda have long since been a staple of the West African trans-Saharan trade network. We shall protect and propogate this resource."
 
 NAV_ideas: "Basque Ideas"
 NAV_ideas_start: "Basque Traditions"
 NAV_ideas_bonus: "Basque Ambitions"
 nav_sailors_of_viscaya: "Sailors of Bizkaia"
 nav_sailors_of_viscaya_desc: "The Bizkaiko Golkoa, our main home coast, is one of the most treacherous and dangerous ocean regions in the entire known world. The bay is regularly battered with storms, rogue waves and unusually fierce ocean currents. The mere act of coastal fishing is considered a dangerous endevor, as such even a fresh basque sailor is a master of the sea when compared to the most seasoned foreign mariners."
 nav_taming_the_winds: "Taming the Winds"
 nav_taming_the_winds_desc: "Our storm ridden coast is perhaps the greatest filter any seafaring nation could hope for. Beacuse if you tame Bizkaia, any ocean storm becomes a mere lake ripple. With the water under your control, all you need now is to tame the wind."
 nav_the_ocean_call: "The Ocean's Call"
 nav_the_ocean_call_desc: "For ages we have been a coastal people. Even so though, our experience can only bring us so far. We must find a way to chase the whale pods to the farthest depths of the ocean, and the newly made triangular sail advancements by the muslims of Cordoba might be exactly what we need. At last, we will awnser the call of the ocean."
 nav_iron_forges_of_navarra: "The Iron Forges of Navarra"
 nav_iron_forges_of_navarra_desc: "Proud as sailors we might be, we do not only live of fish, whale meat and salt! The basque are a hardy and industrial people, and from the mountains of the Pirinioak, flows the iron ore that we tirelessly work to bend and mold to our desire. Mine forth! Let our nation be one with solid foundations of iron and stone."
 nav_navarrese_company: "The Navarrese Company"
 nav_navarrese_company_desc: "Fierce, unwavering, proud and disciplined. The navarrese mercenary company is the pride of every basque son and daughter. Famed for their battle prowess and acessible prices (not like those other mountain mercenaries). We could make use of such an experienced army to defend our own lands! Let us strike a deal with our countrymen."
 nav_private_armies_state_forts: "Private Armies serving in State Forts"
 nav_private_armies_state_forts_desc: "We must admit, we haven't put much stock in a national army to defend ourselves. Why should we? We have the Navarrese Company to keep us safe; and besides, it is much more efficient for the state to put its resources in the navy and its marines, to protect our whalers and merchants overseas. We shall expand the mercenary contracts and let private companies garrison our forts and worry about the defense of our borders."
 nav_global_whaling_monopoly: "Global Whaling Monopoly"
 nav_global_whaling_monopoly_desc: "We have done it. We have chased the golden whale from the Bizkaiko Golkoa, westwards to the new world, southwards to the country of ice and northwards to the polar reaches. Our whalers are unmatched, we have continously outdone everyone and crushed every upstarts to our industry. Our nation now lives through a golden age, one that is fueled with bluber and oil. Wherever we look, wherever we go, whale oil has become the source of our entire economy and every day, the demand for our oil increases overseas. Sharpen those harpoons boys, beacuse this prosperity shall never end!...right?"
