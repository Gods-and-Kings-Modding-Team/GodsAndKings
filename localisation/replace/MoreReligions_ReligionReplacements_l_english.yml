 KARMA_DESC2:0 "Karma represents the divinity of your past actions in the eyes of the Buddhist faith and will rise or fall depending on the morality of actions you take. Too high Karma means you will gain the trust of the Sangha and become a paragon of vitrue at the cost of losing the trust of the common soldier, while too low Karma will make you a fearsome warlord - however, you will suffer in the diplomatic sphere. The ideal ruler will walk the middle path, gaining the most from both aspects."
