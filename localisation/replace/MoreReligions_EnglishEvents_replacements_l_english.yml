 flavor_eng.EVTNAME9107: "The Court of Star Chamber"
 flavor_eng.EVTDESC9107: "The Court of Star Chamber was a court of law which evolved from meetings of the king's royal council. Although its roots go back to the medieval period, the court only became powerful as a separate entity during the reign of [Root.Monarch.GetName]. In 1487 the court became a judicial body separate from the directly underneath the Crown, with a mandate to hear petitions of redress. The Court of Star Chamber was named for the star pattern painted on the ceiling of the room at Westminster Palace where its meetings were held. In a sense the court was a expediting committee."
 
 flavor_eng.EVTDESC9116: "Sir Francis Walsingham was [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s Private Secretary. His main achievement was the perfect organization of a secret service and spying network that proved extremely efficient in aborting all conspiracies against the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s life and all other political and diplomatic plots. Extremely anti-Iberian, he was also the protector of Drake and financed most of the famous privateer's early expeditions against the Peninsular power."
 
 flavor_eng.EVTDESC9114: "In [GetYear] the Catholic [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] married [Root.Monarch.GetName] of Spain, a union that opened great possibilities for both England and Spain. [Root.Monarch.GetName] was granted the title of King of England, but was not allowed to govern the country. But the imminent question of importance was over religion. The Act of Supremacy had given clerical control to the monarch, but the people of England were sundered over religion. Catholics demanded papal authority, while Protestants wanted liberal clerical laws. [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] chose to throw in her lot with the fanatical Catholics, and a wave of terror commenced, earning her the nickname 'Bloody [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'."

 flavor_eng.EVTDESC9117: "English financier, born in London, and educated at the University of Cambridge. After attending the university, he was apprenticed to his uncle, a merchant, in whose service he displayed unusual business ability. In later years he became one of the wealthiest men in England. In 1551 he was appointed a factor, or royal agent, by [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName]. Charged with the management of the royal debt abroad, he virtually liquidated it by adroit financial manipulations on the bourse, or stock exchange, of Antwerp. He was knighted by [Root.Consort.GetTitle] [Root.Consort.GetName] in 1559. While serving as her financial agent abroad, Gresham found that his tasks were difficult to execute because of the lower value of English currency in relation to the currencies of other countries."
 
 flavor_eng.EVTDESC9121: "[Root.Monarch.GetName]'s popularity began to wane towards the end of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] reign. Overseas wars dragged on inconclusively. The Privy Council became less tractable and began to object to the abuse of the crown's grant on monopolies, which was used to reward [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] favorites and tolerate considerable corruption. A last Golden speech in London in [GetYear] reaffirmed [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] love for [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] subjects, but it came in the context of a bitter clash over crown monopolies, which [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] ceased from."

Compromised in many scandals, he loses his functions but is recalled upon the advent of the [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] dynasty.

Initially destined for a military career, he became a deputy in the Commons, member of the Whigs and an ardent patriot. Striving to give England a world maritime empire, he lead the coalition government of 1757 despite the profound hatred of the Crown at the time and obtained decisive results in [governor_province.GetRegionName].

 flavor_eng.EVTNAME9150: "William Pitt was the second son of William Pitt, 1st earl of Chatham. In December 1783, Crown Authorities took the opportunity to dismiss the coalition and asked the 24-year-old Pitt to form a government. In 1788 he signed the Triple Alliance between Britain, Prussia, and Holland, thereby ensuring that in a future war his country would not be bereft of allies as it had been during the American Revolution. In 1790 he demonstrated Britain's renewed power and prestige by negotiating a peace between Austria and Turkey. In 1784 he passed his own India Act, creating a board of control regulating Indian affairs and the East India Company. Finally, in 1791 the Canada Constitutional Act was passed. London became responsible for the government of both Lower and Upper Canada, but both provinces were given representative assemblies."
 
 women_history_events.21: "Jane Austen was an English novelist who's works of fiction became ubiquitous at the end of the 18th century and beyond. Her works explored the social standing of women in English society at the time, as viewed through the lens of a disillusioned socialite of the time. Bordering on pyschological horror, her words painted a visceral and oppressive atmosphere women endured, even in the upper crust of society. Because of its combatative nature, her works were published anonymously; first 'Sense and Censure,' then her most famous work, 'Pride under Prejudice'. Shortly afterwards, 'Mansfield Square' and 'Anna'. Today she is regarded as a figure for social advocacy and many interpret her works through a feminist lens."
