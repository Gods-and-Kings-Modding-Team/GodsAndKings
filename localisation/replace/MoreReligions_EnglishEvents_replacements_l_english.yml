 flavor_eng.EVTNAME9107: "The Court of Star Chamber"
 flavor_eng.EVTDESC9107: "The Court of Star Chamber was a court of law which evolved from meetings of the king's royal council. Although its roots go back to the medieval period, the court only became powerful as a separate entity during the reign of [Root.Monarch.GetName]. In 1487 the court became a judicial body separate from the directly underneath the Crown, with a mandate to hear petitions of redress. The Court of Star Chamber was named for the star pattern painted on the ceiling of the room at Westminster Palace where its meetings were held. In a sense the court was a expediting committee."
 
 flavor_eng.EVTDESC9116: "Sir Francis Walsingham was [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s Private Secretary. His main achievement was the perfect organization of a secret service and spying network that proved extremely efficient in aborting all conspiracies against the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s life and all other political and diplomatic plots. Extremely anti-Iberian, he was also the protector of Drake and financed most of the famous privateer's early expeditions against the Peninsular power."
 
 flavor_eng.EVTDESC9114: "In [GetYear] the Catholic [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] married [Root.Monarch.GetName] of Spain, a union that opened great possibilities for both England and Spain. [Root.Monarch.GetName] was granted the title of King of England, but was not allowed to govern the country. But the imminent question of importance was over religion. The Act of Supremacy had given clerical control to the monarch, but the people of England were sundered over religion. Catholics demanded papal authority, while Protestants wanted liberal clerical laws. [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] chose to throw in her lot with the fanatical Catholics, and a wave of terror commenced, earning her the nickname 'Bloody [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'."
 
 flavor_eng.EVTDESC9117: "English financier, born in London, and educated at the University of Cambridge. After attending the university, he was apprenticed to his uncle, a merchant, in whose service he displayed unusual business ability. In later years he became one of the wealthiest men in England. In 1551 he was appointed a factor, or royal agent, by [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName]. Charged with the management of the royal debt abroad, he virtually liquidated it by adroit financial manipulations on the bourse, or stock exchange, of Antwerp. He was knighted by [Root.Consort.GetTitle] [Root.Consort.GetName] in 1559. While serving as her financial agent abroad, Gresham found that his tasks were difficult to execute because of the lower value of English currency in relation to the currencies of other countries."
