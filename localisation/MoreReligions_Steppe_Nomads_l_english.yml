 #Steppe Events
 MR_steppe_generic_flavor.1.t: "Restoration of [1816.GetName]"
 MR_steppe_generic_flavor.1.d: "The cosmopolitan city of Khanbaliq was once the most vibrant city in the North of China, full of people from all different cultures. Unfortunately, it was burnt to the ground by the Han pretenders after the Yuan abandoned it in 1366. The Han have neglected the old central capital, opting to establish their capital in the more defensible and central city of Kaifeng, close to their Southern adversaries.\n\nWith the city falling into our hands we are now in a position to restore it to its previous splendor. Its strategic position on the Grand Canal will be of great benefit to us, should we re-open the sections that fell into dissuse under the Han. It will also be a symbolic victory, with its ties to previous dynasties."
 MR_steppe_generic_flavor.1.a: "A fitting capital."
 MR_steppe_generic_flavor.1.b: "[Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] suits our needs more."
 MR_steppe_generic_flavor.2.t: "The Puppet Khagan"
 MR_steppe_generic_flavor.2.d: "The descendants of the second son of Genghis - Chagatai Khan - were once the sovereigns of a realm stretching from Turfan to Bukhara. In 1346, local influential nobles led by Amir Qazaghan of the Qara'unas took the reins of government, reducing the descendants of Chagatai to little more than birds in a cage used to legitimise their rule.\n\nFollowing our successful conquest of Qarshi, the Khan's palace fell into our hands - and with it - the Khan himself.\n\nMany in our court believe that the Qara'unas had the right idea, using the Khan to legitimise their rule. Should we do the same, we would have just cause to reconquer the lands of the Ulus of Chagatai in his name.\n\nThere are loyalists of the Khan in our court who believe that we should take this a step further by unlocking the Khan's cage and letting him take the reins of power in respect of his pedigree, while our leader serves as his chief advisor."
 MR_steppe_generic_flavor.2.a: "He will legitimise us from his ivory tower."
 MR_steppe_generic_flavor.2.b: "It would be an honour to serve a man of such pedigree."
 MR_steppe_generic_flavor.2.c: "Let him rot.."
 MR_steppe_generic_flavor.3.t: "The Fall of Kyiv"
 MR_steppe_generic_flavor.3.d: "The Great City of Kyiv now lays defenseless before us, with not a single armed man left to resist our ambitions. The once lively city sits dead quiet in anticipation as our victorious Khan deliberates on what to do with the Pearl of the Dnieper.\n\nGrievances against the traitorous Sartakovs are rife within our ranks, and the wealthy city is rife with wealth that would better serve the pockets of our men than the people of Kyiv. Should we opt to repeat the treatment we gave the city in 1240, we must do it thoroughly this time. Nothing will remain, the city will be reduced to a scorched piece of nature."
 MR_steppe_generic_flavor.3.a: "Wipe it off the map!"
 MR_steppe_generic_flavor.3.b: "The Sons of Sartak had the right ideas...."
 MR_steppe_generic_flavor.4.t: "The Religious Question"
 MR_steppe_generic_flavor.4.d: "[Root.GetName] stands at a religious crossroad. Our ancestors practiced religious tolerance, allowing each and every religion to thrive in the vast Mongol Empire, which carried great benefits.\n\nWe exist under different circumstances however, so it may be prudent to ensure that all our subjects follow our example under the light of [Root.Religion.GetName]."
 MR_steppe_generic_flavor.4.a: "We can learn much from each other."
 MR_steppe_generic_flavor.4.b: "United under one faith!"
 MR_steppe_generic_flavor.5.t: "The Wild Fields"
 MR_steppe_generic_flavor.5.d: "The sparsely populated wild fields of the Dnieper have served as grazing grounds for nomads for time immemorial. The fertile lands are rife for agricultural development however, and many states have attempted to establish agricultural colonies but all have failed due to the dominance of the nomadic ways.\n\n This changed when the Sartakovs became the custodians of Ruthenia. They've had some success establishing settlements on the fertile dark soil unique to the region, but the lands are now in our possession. We could potentially opt to maintain the already-existing settlements to benefit our people by reaping the yields of the land, and expand them by moving people in from across our vast empire."
 MR_steppe_generic_flavor.5.a: "Fertile soil worth investing in."
 MR_steppe_generic_flavor.5.b: "Foolish words of sedentism..."
 MR_steppe_generic_flavor.6.t: "The Dynasty Proclamation"
 MR_steppe_generic_flavor.6.d: "Few expected that we would become a candidate in the running race for the dragon throne, and even fewer believed that we would emerge as the strongest power. [Root.Monarch.GetName] has proven all of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] detractors wrong, and now stands as the paramount figure in China.\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] stands at the royal palace of [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName], ready to issue a proclamation on the establishment of an official Chinese dynasty. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] proclaims the...."
 MR_steppe_generic_flavor.6.a: "Yuan, back in control!"
 MR_steppe_generic_flavor.6.b: "Heilong, born from the Amur!"
 MR_steppe_generic_flavor.6.c: "Unnecessary..."
 randomeventsstapehordes.17.EVTOPTB: "Bring the gavel down on the survivors."
 tribal_succession.1.c: "The succession laws are clear, [Root.Consort.GetName] shall rule until $HEIR$ comes of age."
