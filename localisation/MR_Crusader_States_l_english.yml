  cs_powerful_fleet_title: "A Powerful Fleet"
  cs_powerful_fleet_desc: "With our survival over the ages largely dependent on our lifeline by sea to the Christian powers back in Europe, not to mention the money earnt by trade leaving our ports, it is vital for us to have a strong enough fleet to protect ourselves. Furthermore, if [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] wishes to, perhaps, invade any neighboring principalities, a squadron of transports and war galleys to protect them would be a great boon."

  ati_dynastic_ties_title: "Dynastic Ties"
  ati_dynastic_ties_desc: "There is a long history of intermarriage for alliances between all the Christian Princes of the East, but we in Antioch have enjoyed pride of place as the strongest Prince of Outremer since the collapse of the Kingdom of Jerusalem, and thus enjoyed the closest ties to our neighbors in Little Armenia--Cilicia--and their cousins Armenia proper. If we were to seize Little Armenia, we could then press our claims to the rest of Armenia."
  ati_dynastic_ties_effect_tt: "If Armenia exists, we will get a §Yrestoration of union§! casus belli on them.\nOtherwise, we will get §G50§! prestige (excess will be converted to monarch points) and a permanent claim on the §YArmenia Area§!."

In times past, Edessa stretched from just beyond the city of Antioch itself in the west to the Euphrates in the east, north into the Anatolian foothills and south into the plains of Iraq. While that land and the base of power it lent us may have slipped from our grasp, who is to say that the strength of Edessa is yet spent?"
  edd_edessa_ascendant_title: "Edessa Ascendant"
  edd_edessa_ascendant_desc: "Now that we have grown stronger than our old rivals in Antioch, we finally have a chance to succeed in our old ambitions to reunite our realm with theirs. With a little time and preparation, we can prepare a coup so swift none will be able to oppose us."

  cs_seek_italian_military_support_title: "Italian Military Support"
  cs_seek_italian_military_support_desc: "Now that we granted the Italians a trading concession, by keeping the foreign merchants and our own coexisting in harmony, we can leverage their connections to provide some much needed mercenary aid at a cut-rate price. Rest assured, their quality in battle won't reflect that."
  cs_seek_italian_military_support_reward_TT: "Will unlock a special mercenary company, the Italian Company of Outremer, composed of infantry specialized in ranged combat. This company will be cheaper for us to hire."

  cs_looming_mamluks_desc: "The Mamluks are the great and ever-present menace looming above our small principality, threatening always to push us and all Christians into the sea if we let our guard down. Constantly, their cavalry raid outlying settlements, pillaging and taking captives, and their tariffs on trade are beyond extortionate, when they aren't deciding to block caravans entirely.

  crusader_states_grand_wedding.d: "In doubtless the diplomatic triumph of [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s reign thus far, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] has managed to secure marriage alliances with all the other Princes of Outremer. Furthermore, though the betrothals were not announced all at once, the nuptials are to be held in a single massive ceremony in [Root.GetCapitalName] in three weeks. Rumor has it that notables will be coming from as far afield as Italy and France to witness the spectacle. The only remaining question is how we should prepare for the celebrations..."

  crusader_states.5.d: "\"Awake! Alarm! Awake!\"\nThe cry was soon echoing from the palace throughout the neighborhoods of Antioch, but frightened citizens remained in their homes as troops of horsemen without banners thundered down the streets. First smoke, then great tongues of flame rose from the Prince's Palace on the foothills of Mount Silpius to lick the sky, casting an orange hue on the maille of the ominous riders gathering in squares and watch towers. While the citizens nearest the palace hurried to bring water from the wells and stop the blaze from spreading, they failed to notice the signals spreading from Southern Gate and adjacent towers in the city walls, until the whole city was encircled.\n\nBy the morning, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] was in the city with another thousand men-at-arms in gleaming armor, carrying the yellow banner of Edessa. Calmly, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] directed the citizens and some of [Root.Monarch.GetHersHis] own men in putting out the last of the fires and beginning to clear debris as if it were the most natural thing in the world. The few troops not dead or bribed, still loyal to the fallen [ATI.Monarch.GetTitle] of Antioch were holed up in the citadel, but it was only a matter of time before they surrended to the eery calm that had befallen the rest of the city."

  crusader_states_papal_legate_good.t: "New Papal Legate Arrives"
  crusader_states_papal_legate_good.d: "His Holiness has appointed a new papal legate to serve the people of Outremer. As the (official) supreme authority over all of God's flock from the Bosporus to Alexandria, including being above our own local bishops, this can have a serious effect on our rule among the faithful, and, more importantly, our influence with the Holy See back in Rome.\n\nThankfully, as we have maintained good relations with the Pope, His Holiness has seen fit to appoint a former Antiochean bishop that we have a good relationship with."

  crusader_states_papal_legate_neutral.t: "New Papal Legate Arrives"
  crusader_states_papal_legate_neutral.d: "His Holiness has appointed a new papal legate to serve the people of Outremer. As the (official) supreme authority over all of God's flock from the Bosporus to Alexandria, including being above our own local bishops, this can have a serious effect on our rule among the faithful, and, more importantly, our influence with the Holy See back in Rome.\n\nBecause our relations with the Holy See are merely a polite formality, we have been given yet another Italian prelate hoping to run out his time and enrich himself on the tithes of our people before returning to Rome to be made a Cardinal somewhere. Perhaps if we were to improve the Pope's opinion of us, we could get a better deal next time..."

  crusader_states_papal_legate_neutral.d: "His Holiness has appointed a new papal legate to serve the people of Outremer. As the (official) supreme authority over all of God's flock from the Bosporus to Alexandria, including being above our own local bishops, this can have a serious effect on our rule among the faithful, and, more importantly, our influence with the Holy See back in Rome.\n\nDue to our bad relations with His Holiness, he has pawned off the half-wit third son of some German duke on us. The man is haughty, ignorant, and likely to agitate our own people almost as much as the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]."
