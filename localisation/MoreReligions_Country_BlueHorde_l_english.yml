 mr_blh_c1a1_title: "Barter with the Bishops"
 mr_blh_c1a1_desc: "Ever since the rule of the Blue Horde under Orthodox Christianity by way of the leadership of Sartaq Khan, the religious leaders of Ruthenia and especially the urban centers of Kiev have played a large role in the politics of the state."
 mr_barter_with_bishops: "We will not lose stability if Ugechi Khan dies before the Blue Horde has reformed"
 
 mr_blh_c2a1_title: "Loyalty of the Tribes"
 mr_blh_c2a1_desc: "Traditionally the tribal leaders led the state, but since the conversion to Christianity, they have been slowly relegated to delegating the countryside. We must convince them that progress towards a modern state is not something to be worried of."
 
 mr_blh_c3a1_title: "Diplomacy to Bulgaria"
 mr_blh_c3a1_desc: "Chaka Khan, ruler of the Bulgarian Ilkhanate is an honorable man serving alongside and under his brother to rule Ruthenia and Bulgaria. We have caught wind that his son, however, wishes to expand his lot and has has spent much time trying to convince the Khan to do... something if Ugechi were to pass suddenly."
 mr_diplomacy_bulgaria_tt: "The odds of Bulgaria invading are greatly reduced"

 blue_horde_flavor.1.t: "Ugechi Khan Passes"
 blue_horde_flavor.1.da: "Despite his best efforts, Ugechi Khan never completely succeded in transitioning to a feudal state. On his departure from our world, the tribes retained a great deal of influence in regional politics, especially far away from the center of Kiev. This of course has put the Metropolis at odds with the tribal leaders who now have ample oppurtunity to vie for power in the disorganization left behind by this passing.\n\nFailing to completely cowe the Bulgarian Khanate, the Khan's ambitious nephew Theodore turns his gaze to Kiev."
 blue_horde_flavor.1.db: "With incredible effort, the Khan spent the last years of his life getting all matters of succession, administration, and organization in order. Countless meetings and discussions with the clergy and the tribal leaders and the old nobility of this land have brought the Blue Horde together to a modern feudal state."
 blue_horde_flavor.1.a: "A sad day made even more."
 blue_horde_flavor.1.b: "We pray for his passing."
 blh_church_regency: "\n§YChurch authorities will rule in interregnum§!\n"
 blh_bul_may_dow_us: "§RThe Bulgarian Ilkhanate may declare war on us§!"
 
 blue_horde_flavor.2.t: "The Khan of Kiev Dies!"
 blue_horde_flavor.2.d: "To the surprise of no one, the aged Khan Ugechi has died, leaving behind much unfinished work in bringing together the various powers of the state. Though a sad day, there will be oppurtunity to grieve after this matter is settled.\n\nBulgaria, led by the Khan's younger brother, made it's own name as a formidiable force - but under the rule of the Khan in Kiev. Now, Chaka Khan, with much convincing from his son now considers taking Kiev himself, lest it be ruled by those duplicitous clergymen."
 blue_horde_flavor.3.a: "Sieze Kiev!"
 blue_horde_flavor.3.b: "An invasion at this time is as good as betrayal!"
 blue_horde_flavor.3.c: "We must honor our agreements."
 blh_random_chance_to_turn: "Theodore will attempt to seize control."
 
 blue_horde_flavor.3.t: "Envoy from Bulgaria"
 blue_horde_flavor.3.da: "Thodore of Bulgaria has assumed control of his forces and is on his way to Kiev as we speak! It is any wonder why Chaka Khan as allowed this, but many have suspected that he would aim for Kiev someday."
 blue_horde_flavor.3.db: "The Ilkhanate has cast off it's chains, citing the death of Ugechi Khan as the dissolution of their contracts."
 blue_horde_flavor.3.dc: "In an great display of honor, Chaka Khan has stayed loyal to his brother's wishes, and continues to rule Bulgaria as he had done. This is not without sad news, as it was later discovered his own son had plotted to overthrow him and march on Kiev with is own men."
 blue_horde_flavor.3.a: "They betryal!"
 blue_horde_flavor.3.b: "Nothing we can do..."
 blue_horde_flavor.3.c: "Blood runs thicker than water."
 
 blue_horde_flavor.4.t: "Kiev Defects!"
 blue_horde_flavor.4.d: "In the midst of what is essentially tribal squabbling, the Metroplitan of Kiev has brought it upon himself to seperate the city from the rest of the fighting. The large influence of the clergy in court politics, centered within the city, has allowed the city to politically seperate with practically no consequence. Last words about the situation seem to indicate some sort of deal that will be struck with Bulgaria..."
 blue_horde_flavor.4.a: "Them too?!"
 blue_horde_flavor.4.b: "§YPlay as Kiev§!"
 
 blue_horde_flavor.5.t: "Kiev Strikes a Deal"
 blue_horde_flavor.5.d: "An envoy is sent to [BUL.GetCapital.GetName] to work out some kind of peace. The War of Ruthenian Khans, was, of course started to take Kiev. However, like in the days of old, the Khan of Bulgaria may accept a nominal subjugation in the form of tribute. In exchange, we will even allow the Khan to be crowned and baptized in St. Sophia Cathederal as well as adopt titles previously beloning to Ugechi Khan."
 blue_horde_flavor.5.a: "Become their tributary"
 blue_horde_flavor.5.b: "Pay them for some leeway"
 blue_horde_flavor.5.c: "We can make it on our own"
 MR_IF_THEY_ACCEPT_TT: "If they accept:\n"
 
 blue_horde_flavor.6.t: "An offer from Kiev"
 blue_horde_flavor.6.da: "The [KIE.GetMonarch.GetTitle] of Kiev, having defected from the Blue Horde, has proposed submission to the Bulgarian Khan offering to pay tribute and officiate various titles in exchange for some local autonomy."
 blue_horde_flavor.6.db: "The [KIE.GetMonarch.GetTitle] of Kiev, having defected from the Blue Horde, has proposed submission to the Bulgarian Khan offering a large sum of coins in exchange for some leeway in this war."
 blue_horde_flavor.6.a: "A reasonable offer."
 blue_horde_flavor.6.b: "Such a short time will only do so much."
 blue_horde_flavor.6.c: "I refuse."
 
 blue_horde_flavor.7.t: "Triumph of the Blue Horde"
 blue_horde_flavor.7.d: "The turmoil following the events of the death of Ugechi Khan has finally subsided. A relative of the former Khan, [Root.GetMonarch.GetName] has been found and legitimized as his successor. Theodore has been found dead in creek with an arrow piercing his chest; his father has abdicated in both equal measures of grief and shame. The Bulgarian Ilkhanate has been dissolved."
 blue_horde_flavor.7.a: "I have little sympathy for traitors."
 
 blue_horde_flavor.8.t: "Collapse of the Blue Horde"
 blue_horde_flavor.8.d: "As empires rise and fall, so did ours. Once the seat of civilization in Eastern Europe, poised to claim and make real the title of 'Third Rome', it has all come crashing down in one fell swoop. Perhaps we may recover, but it will be a long and arduous road."
 blue_horde_flavor.8.a: "It begins."
 
 blue_horde_flavor.9.t: "The Second Bulgarian Empire"
 blue_horde_flavor.9.d: "With the defeat of the Blue Horde, the Bulgarian Khanate has ascended to greater heights than it could ever reach as a subordinate. The military prowess that was matured as a march of the Blue Horde and feared throughout Europe and across the steppes has been set loose upon the world.\n\nThough it is ruled by and in the fashion of a Mongolic state, the Second Bulgarian Empire follows in the footsteps of the First, jockeying for position as a top dog in Eastern Europe. With the center of the Ruthenian Orthodox Church and multiple key urban centers, who can deny it?"
 blue_horde_flavor.9.a: "God have mercy on our enemies."
 
 blue_horde_flavor.10.t: "Out of the Blue"
 blue_horde_flavor.10.d: "As each of the former tribal leaders kneel and swear loyalty to the [Root.GetMonarch.GetTitle] of the former Blue Horde, the final acts of fealty are complete. What once was a state formed around the old Mongol traditions and clans, we have created a modern state. It is only befitting that such a drastic change of policy and character be met with an equally drastic inauguration.\n\nAs the [Root.GetMonarch.GetTitle] stands to greet the his new subjects, he looks past them and into the crowd of other counts and dukes and new nobles for this new country. He waits for the lull in the cheering and declares: On this day, in the Year of Our Lord [GetYear], this country will be christened as..."
 blue_horde_flavor.10.a: "Ruthenia!"
 blue_horde_flavor.10.b: "Ukraina!"
 blue_horde_flavor.10.c: "Cumania!"
