 mr_france.1.t: "Bishop Electors Side with France"
 mr_france.1.d: "The decline of the central French Kingdom long ago saw the return of an elective monarchy to the seat of the French Crown. The infighting brought about a long period of disunity where a number of powerful Bishops, exercising undue power, found their way into the electoral process. For many years these Bishops had a strong hand in determining the French King, but now that the Kingdom has reversed its' fortunes, the Bishops have decided that subservience to the seemingly waning Empire is no longer necessary. Bishops and their respresentatives have approached the crown with a request to back their decision."
