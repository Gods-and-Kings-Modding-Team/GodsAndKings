 mrChinaEvents.0.t:0 "The Prince of Chu's Ambition"
 mrChinaEvents.0.d:0 "It has for some time been the case that princes of the imperial clan of Han enjoy relative autonomy and maintain their own armies, but none in the short history of the state have taken this as far as the current Prince of Chu, Hong Chen. His own heritage is dubious; some claim him to be the son of a Mongol or Jurchen concubine of the previous emperor of Han, who was known to indulge in the company of his multicultural harem.\n\nWhatever standing in the imperial clan he lacked by blood, however, he has made up for through deeds. He excelled in his studies of the classics and now at the age of 36 has already far outstripped the military accomplishments of his older brother, the current emperor. While he cut his teeth defending the northern borders against the threat of Mongol raids, he now resides in Hubei as the Prince of Chu, ostensibly as protector of Han against the threats of Song and Xia.\n\nIt is widely known, even in the upper echelons of the Han court, that he will not be content to remain idle there forever. Surrounded by men loyal personally to him (of both a scholarly and military bent), the Prince of Chu laments the state of China and believes that he may be the one to cure her ills. To claim the full extent of his title, to lay low foreign pretenders, and perhaps to claim the mandate of heaven for himself..."
 mrChinaEvents.0.a:0 "A wildcard to be sure..."
 mrChinaEvents.0.a.tt:0 "§RThe Prince of Chu is too powerful and determined to be dissuaded from his goals. We can only hope that when he makes his move, we are prepared for the fallout.§!" 
 mrChinaEvents.2.t:0 "Filial Impiety"
 mrChinaEvents.2.d:0 "Though the mood was cheery in the palace complex of Hanyang, Hong Chen lay deep in thought. One of his honoured guests, a Confucian scholar whom the prince had previously patronised, approached the contemplative prince.\n\n"My lord, what weighs upon your mind?" asked the scholar. "Your deeds are great and all at this feast are gathered to celebrate your accomplishments and loyally serve you."\n\n"How can I celebrate when I am forced to reside in exile while the land suffers and heaven is displeased?", confided the prince. "Surely, as a learned man, you can understand my thoughts. I must speak frankly - I doubt the ability of my dear brother to restore order to China."\n\nThe scholar nodded slowly in response. "I understand, my lord, but I must urge you not to act improperly against your kin".\n\nHong Chen returned to thought, receiving precisely the response he had feared. Not only was it treasonous and taboo to openly oppose his own brother, attempting to seize the throne would almost certainly pit prince against prince and risk shattering the very order his clan had struggled to build.\n\n"However, my lord, if I may offer advice, your armies are powerful and your cause just.", the scholar continued. "The pretenders who cling to power in the south would surely be scattered before you should you choose to claim what is already rightfully yours - that which was once Chu."\n\nThe prince's eyes lit up. Indeed it was true that he held barely half of the land which had been legally appointed to him. Indeed he had known success on the battlefield against enemies far more fearsome than the weaklings of the south. If the emperor of Han would not annihilate the traitors, what if he could?"
 mrChinaEvents.2.a:0 "At least he's not marching on Kaifeng?"
 mrChinaEvents.3.t:0 "Military Maneuvers in Hubei"
 mrChinaEvents.3.d:0 "We have received troubling reports from our garrison in Wuchang that there appear to be large-scale military operations underway across the Yangtze. What exactly this buildup of forces represents is unclear, but it is certain that a river fleet is amassing and the long-feared Han invasion may soon be upon us."
 mrChinaEvents.3.a:0 "We must prepare!"
 mrChinaEvents.4.t:0 "The Prince of Chu Crosses the Border" 
 mrChinaEvents.4.d:0 "Alarming news has reached Kaifeng that the Prince of Chu has gathered his considerable personal forces and embarked across the Yangtze in an attempt to invade Song territory.\n\nWhile we are no friends of the Song and commend his enthusiasm, his brash action threatens to upend the delicate balance of power in China. The imperial court is now left scrambling for a response to this embarassing development."
 mrChinaEvents.4.a:0 "What is that lunatic doing?"
 mrChinaEvents.5.t:0 "Han Invasion in Hubei!"
 mrChinaEvents.5.d:0 "The reported force concentration on the Han side of the Yangtze in Hubei was worrying, but the crossing of Han forces so soon was altogether unexpected. We have received no official communication from the "emperor" of Han, and the lack of similar preparations elsewhere along the river led many commanders to believe that invasion plans were only in their infancy.\n\nRelations between Han and Song have always been fraught, but it has been decades since we have faced unprovoked aggression on such a scale. For now, all we can do is muster our forces and assess the situation."
 mrChinaEvents.5.a:0 "To arms!"
 mrChinaEvents.6.t:0 "The Great Han-Song War"
 mrChinaEvents.6.d:0 "The Prince of Chu's sudden invasion of Song has left the emperor with only one choice. To fail to act would, at best, doom a member of the imperial clan to certain death on foreign soil. At worst, inaction would put our fragile political establishment on full display to the world as our foreign policy is dictated by our own appanages.\n\nThere is only one action available to the emperor and his court - to join his sibling in war, reluctant though we may be."
 mrChinaEvents.6.a:0 "Our hand has been forced."
 mrChinaEvents.7.t:0 "War is Upon Us"
 mrChinaEvents.7.d:0 "Our worst fears are confirmed. The forces currently rampaging through Hubei and besieging Wuchang are not merely raiders but the tip of the spear. Han forces across the border are now mobilising and it is clear that the long-dreaded war between north and south is now underway."
 mrChinaEvents.7.a:0 "Rally all forces to defend the King of Light!"
 mrChinaEvents.8.t:0 "A State in Decline"
 mrChinaEvents.8.d:0 "Our military defeat at the hands of our greatest rivals has dealt a devastating blow to our legitimacy in the eyes of our own people and the wider world. Only time will tell if we are able to survive the fallout of this disaster."
 mrChinaEvents.8.a:0 "Has heaven forsaken us?"

#Xia (SHU) events
 mrXiaEvents.0.t:0 "The Invasion of Xia"
 mrXiaEvents.0.d:0 "The position of the Xia state has always been precarious, with only the mutual animosity between the rival emperors of Han and Song preventing their commitment to all-out invasion of Sichuan.\n\nAt long last, it seems that this caution has been cast aside and now one of China's dominant powers has sent the full weight of their military might against our beleaguered kingdom. A diplomatic solution is impossible, and our court has no choice but to stand and fight or face certain annihilation at the hands of our vengeful enemies. While our resources are meagre compared to those of our enemies, [Root.Monarch.GetName] must draw on everything Sichuan can provide if [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] ambitions of a unified China under the Xia are ever to come to fruition."
 mrXiaEvents.0.a:0 "Call up all available reserves!"
 mrXiaEvents.0.b:0 "Surely conscripting a few more peasants can't hurt?"
 mrXiaEvents.0.c:0 "Get every able-bodied man on the front, now!"
 SHU_naughtiness_tt:0 "§YExploiting our subjects may be necessary to win this war, but doing so may have consequences in the future!§!"
 SHU_big_naughtiness_tt:0 "§RDesperate measures may substantially improve our chances of defending ourselves, but the long term impact could be disastrous!§!"
 mrXiaEvents.1.t:0 "Replacing our Losses"
 mrXiaEvents.1.d:0 "Upon the outbreak of the war, we raised all we thought possible from the populace in order to defend ourselves. Even this conscription may not be enough, however, as our forces continue to take casualties at a rate we cannot easily keep pace with, particularly with our early deployment of reserve and garrison forces. It may be time to begin scraping the barrel and sending more of the civilian populace to the front."
 mrXiaEvents.1.a:0 "No, we have already asked enough of the people."
 mrXiaEvents.1.b:0 "Scour the countryside for anyone avoiding service!"
 mrXiaEvents.1.c:0 "The elderly and infirm have been getting off too easy."
 mrXiaEvents.2.t:0 "Leading from the Front?"
 mrXiaEvents.2.d:0 "While the war for Xia's survival continues to demand everything our state has to offer and then some, it has become glaringly obvious to many that the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] seems reluctant to make the same sacrifices [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] demands of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] subjects.\n\nUltimately [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] is under no enforcable obligation to take up military command, but it is becoming increasingly clear that personally leading [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] forces could do wonders for [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] legitimacy and the morale of Xia's armies."
 mrXiaEvents.2.a:0 "Of course! It is the duty of a [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] to lead [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] people."
 mrXiaEvents.2.b:0 "I hear the palace is lovely this time of year..."
 mrXiaEvents.3.t:0 "The Cost of War"
 mrXiaEvents.3.d:0 "The economy of Xia was healthy before the onset of the current war, but we are now faced with the reality that our financial resources are dwarfed by those of the rest of China. Such a war was not entirely unexpected, and the government is capable of raising some additional funds to handle the expenses of waging a war for survival.\n\nCalling in favours and selling off state property can only get so far, however. It may be wise to ensure that our war chest is large enough to supply our now oversized armies and sustain a longer defensive campaign, and to do so would require a few "expropriations"..."
 mrXiaEvents.3.a:0 "We cannot stoop so low. Raise funds only through mutually agreed means."
 mrXiaEvents.3.b:0 "Squeeze some ill-gotten gains out of the merchants."
 mrXiaEvents.3.c:0 "Take whatever we can get from these leeches."
 mrXiaEvents.4.t:0 "Peace At Last"
 mrXiaEvents.4.d:0 "Our struggle for survival is finally at an end. As soldiers begin to return to their fields, we can only pray that the peace we were able to achieve was worth the price the people of Xia were made to pay."
 mrXiaEvents.4.a:0 "May we always rule with benevolence."
 mrXiaEvents.4.b:0 "Sacrifices had to be made."
 mrXiaEvents.4.c:0 "Xia lies in ruins..."
