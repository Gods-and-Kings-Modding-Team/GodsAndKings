When the lord Thammaracha the 4th came to the Chang Rai, however, a situation developed. While the lord was a pious man, he often had lapses in judgement and fell to temptation. That night, he seemed to have gotten into an altercation after having drunk too much fine rice liquor, and attacked one of the guards attempting to quell the matter. Thus, the guards rightly defended themselves, and sent the king home. He died of alcohol poisoning on the journey, which greatly saddened the ruler of Lan Na, Tilokaracha. However, the upstart brat Thammaracha the 5th used it as an excuse to claim that the Mangrai dynasty must be quelled and subjugated! Thus, the ruler Tilokaracha summoned his troops and prepared for the invasion - it would not be an easy one, but the fate of his kingdom was on the line!"

Their rulers had been subservient to Ayutthaya for some time, but when the Angkor Empire invaded in 1380 and the city fell, the writing was on the wall for them. Soon, they too would be absorbed by the resurging Khmer kingdom. However, in a stroke of luck, issues to the east diverted their enemies’ attention, giving Sukhothai some time to breathe. In those precious few years, the king Thammaracha the 3rd spent much of his time working with nearby allies in Si Thammarat, Pagan, and Lan Na in the hopes of containing Angkor. While talks with Pagan fell apart, the northern and southern Thai kingdoms maintained somewhat positive relations, with Lan Na even entering an alliance with Sukhothai. However, in the year 1440, when the aging Thammaracha the 4th went to visit the Lan Na city of Chang Rai for Song Kran, he was first humiliated and then assaulted by members of Lan Na’s royal guard! There was no reason or apology given, and the beloved king died from his injuries on his way back to Sukhothai. This sparked a crisis, in which the new king Thammaracha the 5th, leapt into action, summoning levies and arming his soldiers, declaring war in 1444 to completely subjugate the enemy!"

 bunga_teratai_war.d:0 "Ananggavarman Srivijaya was placed in a tight situation, to say the least. His uncle Sri Sujavarman was a renowned Vajrayana Buddhist and when he was in power from 1378 to 1402 had attempted to convert the empire of Srivijaya to his faith. This completely and utterly failed and it only built up resentment from the local Mahayana, Theravada, and Hindu population. The king's attempts to push this on the vassals, however, was a bigger issue. Many of the more powerful subject states, which had previously been spared forced conversion, where now being demanded by the Sumatran King to convert to a foreign fath. This act strained the already rocky relationship the metropole had with its periphery. With the loss of Borneo and Malaya in the last century, Ananggavarman was seen as the successor to a line of weak kings who could not defend their own territory, and princes from Majapahit to Pasai now considered their chances of success should they attempt a rebellion. And, in 1446, this moment presented itself to them when a scandal was uncovered. Ananggavarman was estranged with his first wife since they had first wed. However, the truth behind this would not be known until she had returned to her home in Majapahit. There, she told the prince Rajasanagara that Ananggavarman would not bed her and bring about an heir - He was impotent, she cried. The prince of Majapahit took this as an insult, declaring his suzerain unfit and unworthy to rule. Rallying the lords of Pasai and Pagaarruyung to his side, they began an all out war for freedom against Srivijaya. The Bunga Teratai War had begun!"

However, it was not to stand forever. The forces of [MAJ.Monarch.GetTitle] sieged down the fort for months, until finally, a breach in the wall during a late night siege attempt gave them their opening. Close quarters fighting inside the packed barracks, brave soldiers would rush in for the Maharaja, to defend the honor of Majapahit. When the dust had settled, the enemy’s forces were in full retreat, but the cowardly garrison was quickly caught by cavalry brigades. By the time dawn rose over the misty hills, the ancient site of Borobudur was in the hands of [MAJ.Monarch.GetTitle], and many of the local residents flocked to his banners, willing to fight for a true king."

Before many of them had even been able to put on their armor, the walls had been breached. What few men remained prepared for the onslaught of soldiers, and despite however many those brave few guardsmen slew, more kept pouring in through the hole in the wall. Fighting continued for hours, as bodies piled up on each other, and the stench was just beginning to become numb to the defender’s noses. However, soon enough, the captain of the fort ordered a retreat before more lives could be lost; a smart, strategic decision. However, him and his forces were caught just outside in the jungles and were put to the sword before even given the chance to surrender. The brutality of the war continues, and Srivijaya just lost a major foothold in the fight against the usurpers."

Angkor Wat was magnificent, even by Borobodur’s lofty standards; with hundreds of hallways and rooms, thousands of statues and epitaphs, carvings, and depictions of the many sagas of bodhisattvas of days gone by, it was a glorious ode to both the Hindu and Buddhist faith. How could a holy site, as decorated and fantastical as this one, be built by such incompetent and foolish rulers as the Angkor Empire, who, despite their vast wealth and power, could hardly stand against the might of Srivijaya? And so, they proclaimed on the spot that they would instead take up the mantle of the Crown of Jasmine, ruling over the Mandalas and Kingdoms in harmony and with temperment, a glorious empire that shall bring prosperity and power across the lands. When they returned to the captured royal palace in Phenom Penh, they began to properly discuss how they would administer and design this empire. One idea was to maintain the old order, the thalassocracy, by subjugating nobles and kings in cities dotting the trade lanes. This way they could bring the wealth that flows through the straights to us directly, by holding kingdoms under our sway - and should these subjects reject Srivijayan ruling, we simply remove them and place a Sumatran lord in power. However, this might produce anger from the nobles and kings we displace, and perhaps even inspire a popular revolt from those not from Nusantara. However, an advisor, an aging monk, came forth and told our ruler of another option - we instead were to focus on controlling the various inland Mandalas, projecting the strength that our faith held, we could be able to create a new empire, with righteousness and fulfillment as its core tenets. While this might infuriate the heathen lords in our vast empire, it might sway the more faithful to our side.

Pilgrimages died down, sermons stopped being performed, and the temple has begun to decay and slide into ruin as our Maharajas ignored the growing problems.

To our ruler, this was a great deal, so they asked the administrator if they had any ideas. The advisor was a shrewd one and had already thought up a plan: If his lord were willing, he would be given the island to be controlled directly by him, and indirectly by the ruler. This way he could focus on removing the elements of instability one by one, until it was time to integrate it into the fold.

His strife with the great oligarchs of Hungary had left the kingdom fractured and disunited. Charles the I, the supposed rightful heir, had caught the Plague and died, but it was for naught either way. Many Hungarian nobles did not want the young boy to come to power. Instead the oligarchs invited Ladislaus V to rule their land - and while this united the lands of Hungary and Bohemia for a time, the king kept trying to force the Hungarian nobles to bend to his will and join the Empire, something the Hungarians had no desire to do.\n\nThe King had strife with the houses of Poland, and when he launched an invasion on the emperor himself, the houses of Aba, Kan, Czak, and Koszegi rose up in revolt and instead gave the rule to a Hungarian Nobleman by the name of Thomas Szécsényi, who was instrumental in overthrowing the Bohemian forces. The Szécsényi did not get to power alone, however - they appealed to the Polish crown and the Serbian lords, calling upon their aid to overthrow the Bohemian ownership. While Thomas died in 1332 while pushing out the Bohemian influence, his son Michael became the King of Hungary at the age of 15.\n\nAfter being placed on the throne, any attempts at centralization were crushed by the Oligarchs. Instead, a decentralized era began, where each oligarch had immense control over their own territory - during this time, the Serbians and Poles shifted their focus away from the Szécsényi and instead towards the Koszegis and Aba as potential allies respectively, as the Szécsényi seemed paradoxically too proud to be useful puppets but too weak to be effective at controlling Hungary.

His father, Ma Haiji, had rejected both the Mongols and Han calls for subjugation, and as such had his estate besieged by them. As the Chen Han forces encircled his father's estate, the young Ma He escaped the castle and fled to the coastline, eventually ending in the island of Yunnan. There, thanks to his Muslim background, he found refuge among some Arab merchants and traders. \n\n However, he decided that he was not fit for a simple trading life. Stealing several ships, he eventually carved a niche for himself as a smuggler and pirate in the region, slowly building up a dominant political force in the southern Chinese seas. By the early 1400s, Ma He was so powerful that even the Emperor in Beijing had to acknowledge his presence by sending a fleet to defeat him. However, the Pirate King defeated the forces sent by the Chen Han, and grew so bold to actively declare himself an independent state from that of Han China. From Liaoning to Canton, all feared the banners that flew from his ships, as he would take all that was valuable and leave bodies in his wake, and these treasure fleets as they were called reached so far as the Indian continent in the west. His state prospered in the chaos following the Han-Song War, and he became known as "The Pirate King of Hainan," as he also used these funds he gathered to build up the wealth of the people in Hainan, especially the poor. He also was known to say in front of women he wished to woo, women which he seemed to meet everywhere he turned. He would often court three or four women at a time, and was a frequent visitor of the brothels of Haikou. It is here the story of the great pirate ends - he was found dead in one of these establishments, laying peacefully beside a whore who was understandably concerned. Back at his headquarters, others were also worried. He had many an heir to succeed him, each with a strong vision for the future. \n\nAs a Hui Muslim, Ma He was the heir of many synergised traditions. He of course followed the teachings and sayings of the great sage Muhammad, whose name his family bears. His primary figure of veneration however was the sea goddess Mazu, whose authority over the ocean and seafaring is an important one for any sailor to respect. At the same time, he participated in various Buddhist rituals and traditions common to his people. Each of his three sons emphasize a different part of this eclectic tradition. His eldest led a raid on Yemen only to return home a changed man after a pilgrimage to Mecca. His middle child struggled the longest among the common sailors of the Treasure Fleet and saw the importance of continued devotion to Mazu. His youngest believes that the only way forward for the Treasure Fleet is better integration with the authorities that govern China, most of all the powerful temples scattered over the south."

They were far more focused on expanding their own territory in Italy and in the Crusades, thus neglecting their fledgling colony and allowing it to slowly weaken and become threatened by its neighbors. Only through tribute and offering would Africa survive, paying off would-be invaders. This unfortunately also began a decline in relations, and by the year 1290, despite the restoration of a Hauteville on the throne of Sicily, Africa had functionally become independent from the mainland. Their economic and political woes did not cease, and over time revolts rocked the kingdom and eventually left it with barely anything left.\n\nAs we have now retaken the land of Tunisia, we have an opportunity to once more take up Roger II’s dream of expanding Africa, if we so wish."

 MR_sicily_flavor.2.t: "Fate of the Fraticelli Order"
 MR_sicily_flavor.2.d: "In the early 14th Century, just after the Hauteville line returned to the throne of Sicily, a disturbance had taken place across Sicily. An order of Fransiscan monks that preached the the value of Holy Poverty and removing corruption from the Church had arrived - the Fraticelli. These Spiritualists monks arrived in Sicily during their conflicts with other members of their congregation in Tuscany, and despite calls from the Pope to seize and investigate their holdings, the lords of Sicily chose to allow them to remain; the animosity towards the Papacy still ran hot, as they were responsible for several invasion against their homeland.\n\nIn the following century, the Spiritualists managed to expand their holdings and power, eventually winning over both common folk and elite families alike across Sicily. As the Vesper Wars raged in Naples, with the Papacy taking the side of the rebellious nobles, more of the Elite saw the Fraticelli as an alternative they could side with. So, by the 1400s, many of the most powerful provinces in Sicily had sided with and even adopted the new Fraticelli doctrine.\n\nBut the majority of our population are still devout Catholics. They do not wish to be excommunicated from the Church, and they do not agree with the claims laid at the foot of the Papacy. The issue remains prevalent to this day, as Fraticelli monks often harass agents of the Pope that try to infiltrate their regions of control - so, in [GetYear], the Hauteville Court convened to discuss what path they would take to manage this crisis."
 MR_sicily_flavor.2.a: "We shall purge the Fraticelli - they are heretical and must be removed!"
 MR_sicily_flavor.2.b: "We shall embrace the Fraticelli - they preach the truth!"

 MR_ifat_flavor.2.d: "The Afar and Ifat have held a truce since we were forced to acknowledge their independence in 1435. However, the Afar, like many of the tribes of the northern plains, value raiding and attacking cities for wealth and prosperity. So, in 1444, the Afar launched a raid across the border regions with the Ifat, raiding homes, villages, and even the city of Zeila itself. The Ifat Sultan demanded an apology and restitution, but it did not come. So now, as relations crumble and the truce comes to a close, war seems inevitable between the two sultans."

 mrJapEvents.1.t: "The Hotoku War Begins"
 mrJapEvents.1.d: "As the Imperial Throne of Japan fails to reign in their rebellious military governors, the Shugo, a plan was set in place. When [JAP.Monarch.GetTitle] [JAP.Monarch.GetName] announced that Tetsuya Nitta, younger brother of the Shugo [NTT.Monarch.GetName], would be the next Shogun, in a blatant attempt to weaken the institution of the military, they launched an offensive.\n\nIn Sanyodo, the provinces of Nagato, Suo, and Aki were taken by rebel forces, while in Tohoku, Mutso and Ugo were swiftly taken by loyalist forces. The Emperor called his loyal samurai and army to ride and defeat the traitors, and thus, the Hotoku Disturbance had begun. Should the Empire fall, the Shogunate could be restored, or perhaps this event shall only strengthen Imperial rule..."

 mrJapEvents.2.d.1: "Just like at the end of the Heian Period, the era of imperial rule that began in the 14th Century has come to a close. With Shugo forces making their way through the imperial capital and holding the Emperor himself hostage, the fight was over. While the heads of clan Nitta, Shimazu, Hosokawa, Hatakeyama, and Andou all argue behind closed doors about who would be the next Shogun, the samurai and Japan prepare for the next era of military control."
 mrJapEvents.2.d.2: "With the fall of the last rebel stronghold, the Hotoku Disturbance came to a close. With the remaining Shugo having either been executed or they declared their loyalty to his majesty, an Era of Peace and Tranquility has begun across the Japanese isles, forever united."

 mrJapEvents.3.t: "The Sengoku Jidai"
 mrJapEvents.3.d: "At the end of the Hotoku War, the Emperor of Japan had to step back and accept the dominance of the Shogun. Smaller, local, Shugo have expanded their domains and taken charge within their borders as imperial control recedes to the borders of Kyoto. However, despite the five major Shugo rallying behind a single leader during the war itself, in the aftermath they each seemed to have conflicting goals and desires. This eventually led to a situation where a council of all the Shugo could not decide clearly who the next Shogun should be.\n\nIn the absence of a diplomatic solution, military might will decide the victor of these warring states - the Sengoku Jidai has begun!"
