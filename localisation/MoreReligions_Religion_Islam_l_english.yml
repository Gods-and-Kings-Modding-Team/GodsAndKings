 mr_safaviyya_religion_desc: "A sect representing the  form of Islam as propagated by the Safavid Order of Ardabil. Although they recognize the Twelve Imams, they are considered ghulat (heretical) by mainstream Twelvers due to their heterodox beliefs such as the unity of God, Muhammad and Ali, and various folk practices. The Safavid sheikhs are also important figures, perhaps even seen as incarnations of God's light. Centred on the city of Ardabil, propagandists have brought the faith to large swathes of Turkic tribes in northwest Iran and eastern Anatolia, known as the Qizilbash."

Qarmatians, however, reject Al-Mahdi and all subsequent Fatimid Caliphs/Imams, continuing to await the true Mahdi's arrival. The Qarmatians are a millennarian group found in Bahrayn considered particularly fundamentalist and hostile to rival sects, infamously sacking Mecca and desecrated the holy Zamzam well."

Emphasizing the Oneness of God, Almohad legalism and everyday practice follow closely with mainstream Zahiri and Maliki but due to their recognition of Ibn Tumart as the Mahdi and his successor Caliphs, their hostility to other non-Almohad Sunnis and a rejection of Dhimmi protections led to their distinction as a separate sect. In Gods and Kings, the Almohad movement was never successfully extinguished, with member tribes retreating past the Atlas mountains."
