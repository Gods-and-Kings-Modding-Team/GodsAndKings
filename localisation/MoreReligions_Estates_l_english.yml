#Shugo Estate
 estate_shugo: "Shugo"
 estate_shugo_desc: "The Shugo are provincial governors established by the Shogun. Many of these Shugo were intended to be civil appointees as opposed to military governors, but Emperor Go-Daigo opted to instead retain the loyalty of his supporters with these lands, and as such, they have gathered immense amounts of power and authority over the territory they govern. While they are loyal to the Emperor, there are still whispers of overthrowing him and placing instead a Shogun in power. Should their influence grow considerably, and if they saw a chance to reinstall a Shogunate, they would take the opportunity to do so."

 estate_shugo_japan_desc: "The reforms by Emperor Go-Daigo might have removed the Shogun from ultimate power, but he had to make serious concessions to the Shugo and the Samurai to prevent them from siding with the rebels during the Ashikaga Uprising. As such, the reforms benefited the military land owners more than any civilian authority."

 estate_church_ambiguous_allegience: "Ambiguous Allegience"
 estate_church_ambiguous_allegience_desc: "Even thought traces of Christianity in the Romanian region can be found as early as the fourth century, for over a thousand years the political allegience of the locals has been ambiguous at best. Simply referring to themselves as Christians, it has been relatively easy to pass up as righteous believers to those who pledged allegience either to Rome or former Constantinople. Even in the wake of the formation of our principality we have not solved this problem, pretending to listen to the Pope in Rome when dealing with a §YCatholic§!, or to deny their primacy when dealing with an §YOrthodox§!. Truth be told, while His Holiness back in Rome is still an important figure, the way we interpret Christ's teachings is closer to the Byzantine rite. This state of ambiguity should be solved as soon as possible, either by denouncing the Pope for their attempt to claim supremacy over all other patriarchs or fully embracing Them for good."

This meritocratic system shall keep the rice growing efficiently and profits high."

 # Sarraceni estate
 estate_sarraceni: "Sarraceni"
 estate_sarraceni_desc: "The Sarraceni represent the leaders of Heathen communities among our subjects, although primarily Muslim, we have since learned there are many other strange small communities nestled throughout the Holy Land. By coming to accords with local leaders, prominent religious figures, and the old aristocracies and trade families, and integrating them and their people more formally into legal, economic, and social life, we can gain more benefit from them. Giving a few minor concessions (in the grand scheme of things) will allow us to relieve a major headache of resistance and constant friction with our Christian subjects, and as long as we don't go so far to offend His Holiness, it should be quite a beneficial arrangement."
