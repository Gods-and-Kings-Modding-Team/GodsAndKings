 gsc_siege_engineers_desc:0 "Siege artillery has had a somewhat slow start in China due to the region's mighty earthen walls. We will need every new advantage we can get."
 gsc_tributary_relations_title:0 "Resumption of Tribute"
 gsc_tributary_relations_desc:0 "The Han pointing a dagger at our throats has prevented us from truly acting as a proper Huangdi would when it comes to the rule of lesser kingdoms. Now with China consolidating, it's time to change that."

 gsc_southeast_asia_title:0 "Influence in Indochina"
 gsc_southeast_asia_desc:0 "The lands south of China hold many important features for us - they are an important chokepoint for trade and a heartland of the Buddha's teachings - perhaps not the same kind that we follow, but a righteous Way nevertheless.

 gsc_secure_borders_title:0 "Secure the Borders"
 gsc_secure_borders_desc:0 "Our northern frontier will never be truly ours unless there were a series of walls and forts that would allow us to project power into the steppes.

 gsc_no_safe_havens_title:0 "No Safe Havens"
 gsc_no_safe_havens_desc:0 "Many of our enemies' remnants has fled to Korea, where these refugees hope to build a new powerbase to strike back. One way or another - either by taking the peninsula by force or by allying a local kingdom - we must make sure there is nowhere dissidents can hide."
 gsc_surpass_tang_title:0 "Surpass the Tang"
 gsc_surpass_tang_desc:0 "Conquering West into the Hexi Corridor has a double meaning for the Great Song - one, we will walk in the footsteps of the Great Tang, the last truly mighty non-barbarian empire before us.

 gsc_ming_xia_title:0 "Annihilate Ming Xia"
 gsc_ming_xia_desc:0 "Besides Chen Youliang, the Ming Xia are the biggest affront to our desire to project the Red Turbans as one united front against the barbarians. We will make sure the Red Turbans are united this time around - by force if necessary."
 gsc_purge_warlords_title:0 "Purge the Warlords"
 gsc_purge_warlords_desc:0 "Our rising has largely been build on the backs of not just the White Lotus but the cooperation of many independent regional warlords who recognize the Wangming's divine authority but rule semi-autonomously.

 gsc_new_imperial_capital_title:0 "The Imperial Capital"
 gsc_new_imperial_capital_desc:0 "Hangzhou has served as well thus far, but it was ultimately more of a military base for our seemingly-eternal war with the Han.

 gsc_pure_land_title:0 "Pure Land"

 gsc_economic_hegemony_desc:0 "Careful investments has allowed the Great Song to be a global power in not just military might, in not just spiritual authority, but as the heart of the world's economy.

 gsc_role_of_trade_title:0 "The Role of Trade"
 gsc_role_of_trade_desc:0 "More than two centuries ago, the first Song state became unique among Chinese empires to truly embrace and promote mercantilism, bringing them great economic innovation. Whether by necessity or by choice, we have ended up following much of the same path."
 gsc_japanese_relations_title:0 "Japanese Relations"
 gsc_japanese_relations_desc:0 "The weakness of the Middle Kingdom during the century of the Red Turban Rebellion has allowed for Japan, once one of China's periphery states, to start posturing as an equal. This insult cannot go unpunished. Let us remind the Japanese that before they were the Rising Sun, they were the Kingdom of Wa - of dwarves."
