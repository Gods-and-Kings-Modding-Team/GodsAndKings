Due to complicated manorial legalities we do not formally belong to any noble, king or clergym, instead the people of Couto Misto rule by themselves and elect a Juiz to serve as the leader and coordinate the necessaties of the three vilages and its peasantry. This judge is granted by the leaders of each village the three keys of our nation, granting him the legitimacy, trust and right to rule by the people and for the people."

 cms_freedom_from_tribute_desc: "Our defacto independence has given our people a variety of rights and priveleges that peasants in other neighboring realms can only dream of. Perhaps the most important of these is the right to be free from tribute or in other words, taxes. Our people do not pay any taxes, fees or any other sort of monetary restriction that is common in neighboring realms. This gives our peasantry an unheard of level of security and happyness, and altough it has meant the state has less resources to improve itself our people are no strangers to helping a friend and neighbor in need."

 tmm_first: "Heirs of Ayutthaya"
 tmm_first_desc: "The Uthong Dynasty, having been betrayed by the Suphannaphum during the Civil War of 1380, were left wide open during the invasion of Angkor. With no choice left, the Phra Ramesuan abandoned the capital and fled south to a fortified position in Si Thammarat. However, before he left, he ordered many treasures located within the city, religious texts, treasures, artists and performers, to be taken with him. In this sense, he had set up the new state as one to carry on the legacy of Ayutthaya, and carry on the cultural tradition of the once great city."
 tmm_second: "Naresuan the Great"
 tmm_second_desc: "Naresuan the Great, or known by his religious name, Sultan Naresuan Abdul Maalik Alkabir, was one of the Thai kings of legend. Coming to power in the year 1585, the man was raised under the watchful eye of the Imams and other scholars in the palaces of Lavo. By all accounts, the man was as dignified with reciting of the Quran as he was with running the country. However, his true passion lied in the planning and orchestrating of the armed forces. Even when he was young, he would play pretend soldier with his guards, ordering them to march in formation and have pretend battles against rival guards. When he finally rose to power, Naresuan was faced with a difficult situation. In the west, the Second Pagan Empire, led under the command of Narapati III, had finally subjected the Shan tribes in the hills, and used their new levies to attack the region of Lan Na, who had previously been under Naresuan’s mandala. Rallying the troops, the Thai king raced to the battlefield atop his elephant, and proceeded to lead the war from there. As the war raged on, eventually the conflict dragged out into localized warfare around the city of Chang Rai, where, in a stunning battle, the two kings met and did battle. With the will and strength of God behind him, Naresuan was able to defeat the Burmese king, ending the duel with a jab of his ngao. He would go down as one of the greatest sultans the Thai people have ever had."
 tmm_third: "Rebuilders of the Capital"
 tmm_third_desc: "The reconquest of Ayutthaya brought the Uthongs back to their ancestral home, however, it was not a warm welcome. The palace was ransacked, the farms burnt, the people shipped away, the capital was not what it once was. With the opportunity of a lifetime, to showcase legitimacy over Angkor and to sway smaller lords to return to the Thai dynasties, Ayutthaya began a massive reconstruction effort, slowly become more and more like the once great city it was - and with an influence from the West, thanks to inspired builders and architects, the capital gained a look reminiscent of classical Moorish architecture, and became known to many western traders as the Cordoba of the East."
 tmm_fourth: "Sassamedha Laws"
 tmm_fourth_desc: "The Thai kings, even before they became Islamized, were always restrained by court culture. Even if it was not a legally binding set of rules, it was a form of guidelines that a lord must follow. Come the conversion to Islam, the Thai kings quickly molded the new faith’s rules and hadiths into their own style of rulings, and thus the idea of Sassamedha came to be; that a ruler must be able to know how to organize and distribute the food gained by the harvest effectively, so that he would resist the chance of famine or punishment from God."
 tmm_fifth: "Khattiya Laws"
 tmm_fifth_desc: "Likewise with the Sassamedha, the Kattiya was an idea that dictated the ability of the sultans to lead men in the fields of battle. With a corvee system akin to that of Dutch and Al-Andalus, the sultans began to train and recruit large swaths of soldiers both within the reach of the capital and from the various tributaries. With these armies, no heathen army would be able to stand against the rising Islamic power, not even those of the once great Angkor or Pagan."
 tmm_sixth: "Arquebus Weaponry"
 tmm_sixth_desc: "After the conversion of the Thai kings to the faith of Islam, they had begun to meet traders of a similar faith from across the seas. The Sultans of Arabia gave them warm welcomes and gifts from those far away lands, and in return, the Thai kings gave them friendly ports and housing for their traders, who brought with them the firearms of the west - weapons that the kingdoms could use with surprising effectiveness."
 tmm_seventh: "Bastion of Islam in the East"
 tmm_seventh_desc: "The Thai king Ramathibodi II, in the year 1443, had finally embraced the path of the true faith, after being convinced to convert by his many Malaysian courtiers and advisors. Having declared the state to now be one of Islam, he still did not wish to harm or imprison those who he ruled over, as many Thai people still followed the faith of Buddhism, and paid homage to many of the thinkers in Sukhothai, Burma, and even Sri Lanka. In order to maintain his authority, the king molded Islam into a syncretic faith with the Buddhist one, integrating laws and concepts from both faiths into a brand new one. Thus, over time, the Thai people adopted this new faith, and, as the state slowly morphed into one centered around Islam at its core, now looked at its neighbours with a desire to convert and bring the path of the righteous and just to their people. With a blade in one hand, the Quran in another, with the ships from the west and the knowledge they carry in their cities, with artisan skill and military prowess that would make even the great warriors of Egypt take note, the Thai Sultans let out a cry from their terraces overlooking the great empire that they have created; “Mashallah!”"

 ank_rajakuti: "Rajakuti Diplomacy"
 ank_rajakuti_desc: "From the first Rajas at the birth of the Empire to the contemporary era, the great kings would build large structures across their empire, each being sites of prayer and worship. During the reign of Yasovarman I in 889, he had built over a hundred monasteries within the kingdom, each of them including something unique, the Rajakuti, or royal pavilions, areas in which nobles and princes would meet to relax in the warm dry season months. These monasteries built over 800 years ago have since fallen into disrepair, but as each king came to power, they would build more and more of them, leaving behind sanskrit inscriptions and tablets to mark their legacy down upon the these stone monuments. These monasteries, as the country moved into the modern era, became a hub for diplomatic missions for both foreign lords and ladies, but also internal disputes with local princes and chiefs. In that, the Rajakuti showcased the wealth of the king, who would decorate them with gold leaf and inscriptions of their long lineage of kings and their eventual absorption into their deity of choice; a sign of their ultimate power over this universe."
 ank_kshatriya: "Kshatriya Caste"
 ank_kshatriya_desc: "A staple of the Angkor Empire, was of course, the imported caste system from India. While it was far more rigid in the old continent, here there was an element of looseness to it, and that was clearest in the implementation of the warrior class called the Kshatriya. The class mostly defined by it being filled with nobles who led armies into war, they also had a role in being many of the king’s bodyguards and protectors - and for that task, they needed training and patience. Many of the Kshatriya would also be a part of the cult of Shaivism, which dictated practice of both a mastery of the body and mind, especially through yoga, in which some of the most elite members of this caste were shown to have a near perfect control of their own bodies in the activity. This discipline of the body translated onto the battlefield, when the soldiers of Lord Tribhavanadityvarman managed to withstand the Cham raid of 1165, with a mere squad of guards able to hold back over 5 junks worth of raiding ships. These soldiers were the best of the best for Angkor, and would show it time and time again on the battlefield."
 ank_laws_jayavarman_tenth: "Laws of Jayavarman X"
 ank_laws_jayavarman_tenth_desc: "The rule of the Lord Jayavarman X is one of both war and peace. He had come into power after his uncle, Sithean Reachee, died under mysterious circumstances in the year 1347. By the year 1380, had declared war on their old rival of Ayutthaya, finally capturing and sacking the magnificent city. However, problems were still abundant. He came to power only 13 years after a devastating raid by Champa in the year 1333. Their empire was littered with Mahayana monks attempting to convert the local populace. This created a problem for the lords of the region; already plagued by the question of religion, the state was now split even further - Theravadists in the west in the Chao Phraya basin, who once followed the Thai kings, now wished for the lord of Angkor to be a Chakravatin, not a Devaraja. The state Brahmins, who held significant sway over the kingdom ever since Srindrajayerman in 1308 emboldened their power in an attempt to make Hinduism the main faith of the Kingdom. Jayavarman X himself was a Hindu, but he still had to figure out how to save his realm from infighting and tearing itself apart. Thus, in the year 1394, Jayavarman X implemented reforms and modified the legal code, hoping to structure the state in a way to protect and benefit all peoples in his realm, allowing the divisions within the state to heal for a short time, but also to grant the rulers of the Empire the ability to more easily assert control in times of chaos and of great need. His decisions allowed for the Second Resurgence of Angkor, in which the old city had new life breathed into it, and created a new golden age for the empire."
 ank_expansion_angkor_wat: "Expansion of Angkor Wat"
 ank_expansion_angkor_wat_desc: "In 1382, Lord Jayavarman X began to completely remodel the capital in his own image. With the population brought over from Ayutthaya, and the wealth they provided, he managed to completely rework the failing infrastructure of the city. His next project was a new great work - not building a new temple, but instead refurbishing the massive complexes of Ankgor Wat. He attempted to remodel it away from its original design of worshiping Vishnu to instead worship Shiva, but most of the architecture and carvings remained the same, including the famous Churning of the Milk, a painting with Vishnu carved straight into the center. However, this rejuvenated city remained one of the largest cities in the entire world, rivaling that of Peking and dwarfing that of Pagan and Ayutthaya."
 ank_mekong_navy: "The Royal Mekong Navy"
 ank_mekong_navy_desc: "The Mekong Navy was originally a series of river junks, but through a series of kings ordering its creation and production throughout the 16th Century, by the time it was completed, the fleet was one of the largest in the region, dominating the Mekong river and even the Gulf of Khmer, dueling with the Srivijayan fleets in the infamous trade wars of the era - but not only that, during blockades by foreign powers such as the Yuan or even Albion, the Mekong Navy was known for their daring escapades and smuggling maneuvers to relieve sieges and evade capture."
 ank_expand_trade_malaya: "Expanding Malayan Trade"
 ank_expand_trade_malaya_desc: "At the height of the Angkor Empire, the extent to which their mandala reached was as far south as Ligor...yet, it never quite reached the Malay Peninsula. However, there was always a desire to spread their influence down there, and multiple kings had often decried chances lost to take the lands. Now, with Srivijaya out of Malaya, and the Thai kingdoms fractured and weak, the Angkor Empire looks at the squabbling Muslim states with greedy eyes, and drafted a series of merchant fleets to go and survey the land; were they gathering intel, were they preparing the ports for invasion, or were they simply there on a trade mission, only God knew. And the Devaraja knew all too well."
 ank_devaraja: "Rule of Devaraja"
 ank_devaraja_desc: "The Devaraja - a divine being on Earth. A ruler not only with the authority of the great god of Shiva or Vishnu, but who embodies, nay, inhabits the role of the god upon this world. Their legitimacy was holy, their path they tred transcendental. It was not one to be taken lightly: to prove the worth of a god one must build great works, and one must continually showcase their divinity. Before, in the ancient era of Angkor, the Devarajas were often bound by rules and rituals, and had to often answer to the Brahmins and their wishes. However, as time went on and the modern era began to creep in, the rulers of Angkor were able to sway the people to their side, and created a sort of Absolutist state, in which they had the supreme, divine authority from the day they were born until the day they died and were absorbed into the gods they claimed they represented. Should a king fail in his duties, and should they become weak and complacent and lose their way, they will fall and lose their way, and a more righteous man could overtake them. However, should they be able to secure their rule, even the mighty Bodhisattvas and Chakravatin will fear them - the Crown of Jasmine weighs heavily upon the head of mortal men, but not the Devaraja, for him it is light as a feather."

 srj_sailendra: "Sailendra Dynasty"
 srj_sailendra_desc: "The legacy of Srivijaya and the Sailendra dynasty traces itself far back, to before the city was even created, being one of the truly ancient dynasties of Sumatra and Java. Though many of their tales are lost to time, inscriptions and tablets left to showcase their glory remain. The mythical reign of the first Maharaja Santanu, who brought with him the traditions of father India, worshipping Shiva in all their glory. Further still, we recognize the Sailendras as the ones who curated and expanded the faith of Mahayana Buddhism throughout their empire - the practice of Yogacara across their empire was something done in their grand parks and palaces by princes and warriors alike. The legacy held firm throughout the crises of the last 300 years, from repelling the Chola invasions under Sangrama Vijayatunggavarman in 1030 to the rebellion and subsequent defeat of the Kediri Kingdom in eastern Java in 1224, to the Islamic revolution and revolt of Malaya in the 14th century. While the current kings might not quite be direct descendants of these legendary rulers, they still point to their great works and inscriptions much like a child would to their familial home - they seek to legitimize themselves, like the Maharajas of this modern era."
 srj_empire_water: "Empire of Water"
 srj_empire_water_desc: "Srivijaya exists because of the seal. It thrives because of its pathways and trade lanes, taking goods and knowledge from the Middle Kingdom and selling it to the western world on the ships of Arab merchants. The safe havens it provides in its ports allow for the Maharajas to collect tax and wealth, granting the empire the opportunity to grow and further increase control over the territories on the periphery. However, since the Malaya revolt in 1360, and the subsequent loss of territory in that region, traders from the Arab world now find comfort in that peninsula over the Sumatran or Javan ports, due to the religious safety that they can find in Muslim kingdoms. Thus, now more than ever, Srivijaya must maintain a strong navy, to not only protect and control the spice that flows in and out of the region, but also to reassert control over territories once owned by them."
 srj_siddhayarta: "Siddhayarta"
 srj_siddhayarta_desc: "In the ancient days of the early empire, the king Sri Jayanasa, who reigned in 671, was one of the lords who made Srivijaya what it is today - an empire spanning multiple islands. The man, as described by many foreign monks who visited Srivijaya, was a kind and generous one, who had built public parks not only for material beauty but also for the spiritual enrichment that could come from meditating in these new spaces. He was a man who was deeply involved within the Buddhist faith; He kept one of the great works of Asanga, the Yogacarabhumi-sastra, within his great halls, and his pranidhäna upon founding these parks dictated the need for spiritual enlightenment. He was a devout Mahayana Buddhist and sought to spread this wisdom across the seas. He began a great journey, or a Siddhayarta, over the Sunda straits and into Malaya and Java, spreading the power and glory of the empire into those neighboring lands, on both a political and spiritual quest. As he did so many years ago, his successors have made similar missions to conquer or colonize nearby lands, from the southern tip of Borneo to the attempted invasions of the Moluccas, and the many incursions into the Chao Phraya delta. Srivijayan Lords have a vested interest in expanding their holdings across these Buddhist lands, and they do not do it solely with soldiers and ships; they do it with prayer and meditation as well."
 srj_agamas: "Patronage of the Agamas"
 srj_agamas_desc: "The empire has long since been a multicultural hub of Buddhism - it was one of the original hubs of missionaries who would use its ports as a jumping-off point before they would sail to the lands of China, Angkor, and the various islands in the region. It patronized the Vajrayana school and welcomed its many pilgrims from across the globe, the monks of the Theravada doctrine would be safe within the walls of their monasteries, and the empire’s rulers themselves were heavily focused on Mahayana Buddhism, as its syncretic nature aided them in expanding and controlling new territories with heavily isolated and regionalized beliefs. This willingness to support the many doctrines of Buddhism granted stability within the realm as well as widespread prestige and honor - the home of Buddhism in Nusantara, if only rivaled by Angkor to the north. While this patronage did not extend to other faiths entirely, such as Islam and Christianity, this policy did prevent rebellion and uprising within the islands of Java and Sumatra when otherwise they would have collapsed."
 srj_hegemony_straits: "Hegemony of the Straits"
 srj_hegemony_straits_desc: "Since the initial push by Sri Jayanasa, the Srivijayan Empire had a near-complete hegemony of the Straits of Malacca, controlling the incoming and outgoing trade. This was maintained by the Mandala System, a governmental style that was notable due to its focus of a strong central authority near the capital city, and one which waned in influence the farther away a territory was - and with the capital being right on the straits, they were able to maintain that grip more effectively, and with smaller tributary kingdoms up and down Sumatra, Java, and formerly in Malaya, they could extend that control down the trade winds. While the loss of Malaya and Borneo would prove detrimental to trade and power in the region, they are still one of the few kingdoms capable of exerting their influence and status on the straits."
 srj_borobudur: "Borobudur"
 srj_borobudur_desc: "In the Kedu Valley, underneath an active volcano, lies the massive complex of Borobudur, the second largest Buddhist temple in the world. Built-in the 9th Century, this temple was created throughout the reign of three great monarchs, Dharanindra, Samaragrawira, and Samaratungga, all of who poured an incredible amount of manpower and wealth into the project, attempting to make it the ultimate temple in the Nusantara. The temple’s architecture was meant to symbolize many of the core elements and themes of Buddhism; the lotus flower layout and the ten mounting terraces reflect the Boddhivista’s journey to reach enlightenment, the large bell-shaped dome at the top of the terraces merging with the mountainside showcasing exemplary classical Buddhist architecture, a style that would be replicated from Siam to Burma in the centuries to come. Pilgrims of all Buddhist sects would flock to the kingdom, hoping to see the glory in its design and take part in meditation or prayer. It was more than just a temple as well, as time went on, it became a symbol of pride and power for the Sailendra Dynasty.  As the kingdom furthered its control and shifted away from the strict thalassocracy that it was for a more traditional empire, many of its newfound riches were put into place in expanding and developing the site, making it even more wonderful and fantastical than ever before. In 1208, the first Maharaja was crowned in Borobudur, and even still to this day, the lords of the land are still enthroned in the shade of the temple."
 srj_lela: "The Lela"
 srj_lela_desc: "After the failed Mongol invasion in the 13th Century, the use of gunpowder within Srivijaya became commonplace. The cetbang, a Javanese style Lela, was first put to use by the Majapahit kingdom striking out in rebellion against the Srivijayans, and while the rebellion was crushed, the Maharaja at the time adopted the technology and began to implement them on their cannons on their large junk and the walls of their great cities. These Lela were in such widespread use that, by the time the Europeans arrived in Nusantara, the inhabitants were using weapons of a similar quality to those of the foreigners."

 POL_ideas_mr_2: "Imperial Frontier"
 POL_ideas_mr_2_desc: "Poland occupies a land that was once considered beyond the eastern border of the Empire; ironically, Krakow and it's direct crownlands are now prosperous heartlands. Mongol raids, pagan banditry, invaders from the Rus... These threats have tempered our men and kept them prepared, ready to rally to the defense of our lands."
 POL_ideas_mr_3: "Będąc w Rzymie, Czyń jak Rzymianie"
 POL_ideas_mr_3_desc: "Being within - or more appropriately - atop the Empire means talking, a lot of talking. Whether it be the language of the Germans, the Latins, the French, or even The Church, being able to schmooze and negotiate in their tounge will undoubtedly make things easier. Its unlikely people will be clamoring to learn Polish anyway.\n\n`When in Rome, Do as the Romans do.`"
 POL_ideas_mr_4: "Cudzodziemski Autorament"
 POL_ideas_mr_4_desc: "Foreign units and auxillaries have been integrated in militaries the world over for centuries; wealth and stability have brought communities of people from all over Europe to settle in Poland. In fact, those who call this land their new home are just as keen to fight for it as any other Pole. Expanding recruitment standards to allow these new settlers can only bolster our forces; perhaps even bringing new and specific skills that we can learn."
 POL_ideas_mr_5: "Komisja Edukacji Narodowej"
 POL_ideas_mr_5_desc: "As the first Ministry of Education in Europe, this Polish institution was visionary for its time. Originally it was meant to detach the education of Polish scholars from the influence of the Church, which the nobility of Poland foresaw this as a threat to crown soverignty. Eventually the system was expanded to ecompass universities throughout - and sometimes - beyond Poland."
 POL_ideas_mr_6: "Reorganized Choragiew"
 POL_ideas_mr_6_desc: "Even since the rule of Mieszko I, cavalry has played an integral role in the Polish military. Choragiew, literally 'banner', are the main division of units of these cavalry. Choragiew are further sub classified into District Choragiew, Clan Choragiew, and Court Choragiew; formed by knights of a district, clans, and troops of the King, respectively."
 POL_ideas_mr_7: "Rebuild the Villages"
 POL_ideas_mr_7_desc: "After treaties are drawn up and executed, the fighting concludes, but the work does not. Soldiers returning home are continued to be paid for the work of going from town to town rebuilding and replanting lost produce. This was in fact a declaration for humanitarian purpose, but serves a double purpose of fostering good favor with subjects of the crown."

 AFR_ideas: "African Ideas"
 AFR_ideas_start: "African Traditions"
 AFR_ideas_bonus: "African Ambition"
 AFR_first: "Reconquest of Africa"
 AFR_first_desc: "The Kingdom of Africa, initially founded in the 10th Century, was one of the most powerful states in the region for a time. While some, including the Almohad, had to be maintaned via strategic tributary arrangements, many feared to press into the established Kingdom of Africa. However, the revolt of 1354 has left the kingdom in a dismal state. As the rebels of Kairouan continued to harrass trade routes and supply lines, the kingdom's influence became limited to the region around Tunisia. From here, our generals prepare to strike out - we shall retake the land of Africa for ourselves!"
 AFR_second: "Mahdian Trade Wars"
 AFR_second_desc: "We have learned much from the battles of trade with the now rival city of Mahdia. While it used to be under our control, it now lays just beyond our reach, and our merchant fleets now learn to avoid and pull trade away from our once great capital. Until we retake the port, our merchants will dominate the sea."
 AFR_third: "Amil Leadership"
 AFR_third_desc: "We are foreign rulers in a foreign land. We cannot hope to rule through our own will and authority alone - we must rely on local, established lords to help control our countryside. They may establish customs and laws as they wish, with religious laws being left in the hands of the governed. While we are Christian, we shall not enforce our faith on the heathen - they can come to it through the truth and certainty of His word."
 AFR_fourth: "Mediterranean Fleets"
 AFR_fourth_desc: "The Mediterranean is a wild, untameable beast. To match this, our shipbuilders and craftsmen are masters at repairing and replacing destroyed ships. Our sailors are prepared to face the toughest storms and battle from ship to ship, musket and saber in hand."
 AFR_fifth: "Gold Dust Merchants"
 AFR_fifth_desc: "The gold trade comes from the far south, in the land beneath the Sahara. We are simply the end line of it, pushing it up past the coast of Africa and into the wider world. We have mastered monitoring how much gold we are taking in, making sure to not inflate our coffers and destroy our economy. It is a delicate balancing act, but it is one that we must do in order to recieve the riches of gold and silver."
 AFR_sixth: "Rex Africae"
 AFR_sixth_desc: "When Roger II first landed on the shores of Tripoli, he acknowledged no Sultan of the region. He instead conquered and established his own land, creating a mighty kingdom. The Prince of Africa, is what they called him, with gold and silk flowing plentifully into the capital. We were the shining light in the region, making it glorious while the kingdoms around us crumbled into dust. Yet now we too fade into night. We stand at the edge of being destroyed, total annihilation approaching. We are as the Romans; but unlike them, we shall not fall nor shall we fall. The Kingdom of Africa will prosper once more!"
 AFR_seventh: "Modern African Army"
 AFR_seventh_desc: "To fight in the current era, gunpowder is a necessity. Cannons, muskets, all of the firepower that modern weaponry can bring about are crucial in winning a victory. We cannot let time pass us by, we must embrace the changing landscape of battle and truly create a new and improved army for Africa."

 LPB_ideas_bonus: "Lavo Ambition"
 LPB_first: "Theravada Identity"
 LPB_first_desc: "Ever since its diffusion into our state through the trade links with the Pagan Kingdom, Theravada Buddhism has been a key aspect of our cultural identity. We follow the ancient Pali texts, our lords get educated at monasteries and temples, and the Sangha grows with each passing year. We are unified in our faith, and it shall spread to those of foreign worship as well."
 LPB_second: "Lavo-Pagan Wars"
 LPB_second_desc: "In the 11th Century, the Pagan Kingdom invaded from the west, pushing deep into the heartland of the Ancient Lavo Kingdom. It is recorded in our murals and legends that the brave warriors of Lavo fought back against the invading Burmese, who were driven out by their fierce fighting. While the ancient Pagan empire has fallen, its successor in the line of Ava, has risen to power in the west. We shall once more hold the tide against them!"
 LPB_third: "Khom Thai Language"
 LPB_third_desc: "Our script contains elements of both the Mon and Khmer languages. It has risen to be the court language across the realm, especially within the court of the king, where scholars and poets alike use Khom Thai in new and revolutionary ways. The language is still Tai in its origin, but due to its foreign connections it helps us communicate with Khmer diplomats and Mon merchants alike."
 LPB_fourth: "Modernized Chatusadom System"
 LPB_fourth_desc: "The Chatsudom system, by which we establish high ranking officials within our state, is a long held tradition. However, as the years went by, it had proven more and more to be a weak and ineffective system. Too often had overlap and political squabbling got in the way of statecraft. Thanks to the reforms of the state, now the Chatsudom system is running effectively and efficiently."
 LPB_fifth: "Builders of Lopburi"
 LPB_fifth_desc: "Lopburi has been renovated several times in the centuries of its existence. From new monuments, fortifications, temples, barrackses, and so much more, the city barely resembles its centuries old self. Narai's great city continues to grow each year, and soon it shall become the largest city in the land!"
 LPB_sixth: "Phra Prang Sam Yot"
 LPB_sixth_desc: "Built in the era of Khmer dominance, the temple is emblematic of that period. It features Shaivite and Theravada elements, as Jayavarman VII was ruled a Hindu kingdom while being a Buddhist himself. It remains an icon of our state, and the structure and organization of this temple has been a model for all monasteries across the realm."
 LPB_seventh: "Strengthen the Tai Kingdom"
 LPB_seventh_desc: "In the past, the Thai Muengs were united into one state - first under Lavo, then Sukhothai, then Ayutthaya, before its fall. Now, we are fractured and broken, and rule increasingly becomes decentralized. We must unite the various kingdoms and bring them under one banner; the banner of the Lavo!"

 PTC_first: "Kra Isthmus Control"
 PTC_first_desc: "Our kingdom stretches across the Kra Isthmus, from the Andaman Sea to the Bay of Siam. Two major centers of trade in the region that we have a chokehold on due to our strategic position of controlling access from the northern region into the south."
 PTC_second: "Chinese Ship Building"
 PTC_second_desc: "During the fall of Ayutthaya, the Chinese merchants previously stationed in the city of Ayutthaya now had to flee the Angkor Empire. The Han Dynasty at the time was still feuding with the Khmer for refusing to acknowledge their hegemony over the former Yuan tributes, and many merchants feared for their lives. The nobles of Phetchaburi, who now had created their own Muang underneath the thumb of Angkor, styled their city as a center for trade and merchants. As such, Chinese merchants brought with them both their ships and their trade, which the Phetchaburi utilized to build a modernized navy."
 PTC_third: "Mobilize Faithful"
 PTC_third_desc: "In the hills of Mergui, there are many faithful Buddhist communities that would fight for their ruler; a semi-divine lord who was a scholar of the Buddhist traditions. They see him as a father figure, and as such would die for him on the fields of battle."
 PTC_fourth: "Mergui River Fleet"
 PTC_fourth_desc: "The ports of Mergui tap into river lanes and canals that stretch from the Adaman Sea all the way to the heartland of the Chao Phraya. Our ships sail down these rivers, with slim and sleek designs that allow us to speed through the tight water ways. Our armed forces are trained in naval combat, being able to leap from the ships and sack cities before militia forces can even be raised in defense."
 PTC_fifth: "Fishing Industries"
 PTC_fifth_desc: "While the land we control is not the most valuable, the sea around it is bountiful. Shrimp, fish, pearls, and various other marine treasures can be found if one simply chooses to cast a net into the sea. Our communities rely on this industry for both subsistence living and large trading operations."
 PTC_sixth: "Grand Temples and Palaces"
 PTC_sixth_desc: "The clear beaches and blue skies, this is the perfect location for palaces to be built. Summer homes for emperors, temples for monks, and beaches to relax and spread the glory of our realm."
 PTC_seventh: "Local Muang Militias"
 PTC_seventh_desc: "The Phetchaburi mueangs stretch across the jungles and plains of Mergui and Phetchaburi. In here, thousands of smaller towns and villages dot the countryside, which all contribute to the armed forces of our nation. These militias, while not necessarily the most elite troops, are willing and able to fight in the field of battle."

 RTC_first: "Three Pagodas Pass"
 RTC_first_desc: "To cross from Burma into Siam, one must cross through the Three Pagoda Pass. Our founder, Songtham, was stationed at this pass to protect against foreign invasions by the Uthong dynasty. When he established his kingdom, the strategic position allowed him to gain political power within the Angkor mandala."
 RTC_second: "Mercenary Legacy"
 RTC_second_desc: "Songtham, the name of our founder, was a mercenary hired by the Uthong to protect the pass from an incursion by Burmese forces. However, upon arriving, he found a local temple that he felt unexplicably attracted to. When bandits attempted a raid on the temple, he protected it with his own personal guard, thus gaining the title of pious for his actions. When the Suphannaphum collapsed into Angkor, he established his own kingdom in the region, with many of his men following him into a new era."
 RTC_third: "City of the King"
 RTC_third_desc: "Ratchaburi, or the City of the King, is now the seat of the many princes of the Songtham dynasty. As the house grows, so does the domain of our state. With each new conquered city, there is another member of the family placed into a position of power within the realm."
 RTC_fourth: "Integration of Rifles"
 RTC_fourth_desc: "Rifles are a new invention spreading to our corner of the world. They are incredibly powerful, able to rip through armor and shields like they were made of paper. We must integrate them into our infantry's standard equipment in order to properly protect the realm."
 RTC_fifth: "Unify the Thai States"
 RTC_fifth_desc: "The Thai states lay fractured and broken. Ratchaburi stands in a unique place where we can conquer and destroy our rivals, and then bring the fight to the head of our Mandala - Angkor. Soon, even the great city shall be under our control."
 RTC_sixth: "Ratchaburi Acadamy"
 RTC_sixth_desc: "In the aftermath of the foundation of the Ratchaburi state, Songtham built an academy for the training of future soldiers. His army was filled with competent leaders and commanders, who had experienced war for years and years. Since the state was founded on warfare, Songtham placed heavy emphasis on making sure his army surpased all his rivals."
 RTC_seventh: "Professional Armies"
 RTC_seventh_desc: "The mercenary army that was brought into the Ratchaburi territory has now become the standing army of the state. It has transformed from an unorganized, roudy group of warriors that fight for coin and treasure, into a crack military force. They fight for their king, they fight for their state, they fight for their home. None can stand agains tthem, as they stand strong above all else!"

 val_footsteps_al_judhami_desc: "When the Almohad's collapsed, it was the quick thinking and actions of our most honored ancestor, Zayyan ibn Mardanish who reigned in Balansiyya and pushed back against the northern christians. Despite the odds and our small size, we have remained independent and brought prosperity to Balansiyya. If we wish to find true peace however, we must follow the example of our founder, the Wolf King Al-Judhami, and push forth in Iberia and reconquer the lands that the wolf king once tamed."
 val_resist_qurtubah: "Resist against Qurtubah"
 val_resist_qurtubah_desc: "We have long resisted against the northern christians, however it seems the greatest danger comes not from the cross but from our fellow Muslims. Qurtubah seeks to restore the glory of the Almohad's and once more establish a new Al-Andalus Sultanate. We cannot abide by this. We alone have brought stability, harmony and union to Balansiyya while the rest of Al-Andalus flocked to the Ibn Hud opportunists. We will not waver, we will not bend the knee to these illegitimate upstarts. By the grace of the almighty, and with the strength of Al-Judhami we will never be subjects to Almohad lords."
 val_united_against_intolerance: "United against Intolerance"
 val_united_against_intolerance_desc: "If we wish to win against Qurtubah might we need to be united, all of us! We shall push for greater integration with the dhimmi of our realm, and institute greater tolerances that not even Al-Andalus itself had ever attempted. Separate may we be in faith, but equal we may all stand against foreign tyranny. Our most conservative elements might oppose this, but perhaps it shall be good to remind them, that even Al-Judhami Mardanish himself was a native Iberian convert. We must be patient and perhaps in tolerance, together we may find the divine light of truth."
 val_prepare_against_piracy: "Prepare against Piracy"
 val_prepare_against_piracy_desc: " The majorcan pirates have become too great a thorn in our side. We cannot possibly hope to resist against Qurtubah while they pillage and raid our coastline.

 val_welcome_religious_refugees: "Welcome Religious Refugees"

Communities who are only allowed to exist by the whims of the monarch or rulling class. With a simple mood swing, hundreads can be forcefully uprooted and expelled from their homes. We will not abide that here, we shall inscribe it to law, regardless of your faith all shall be welcome in Balansiyya and be treated with the respect and freedom of worship they deserve...as long as they agree to pay their taxes and serve in our armies as well of course. "
 val_embrace_mozarabic_identity: "Embrace the Mozarabic Identity"
 val_embrace_mozarabic_identity_desc: "Centuries of coexistence, sometimes peaceful, sometimes violent, has led to the emergence of a unique cultural expression here in Iberia. Mozarabism, being the result and fusion of both Iberian Christian and Moorish Islamic traditions. This unique blend has seemed to only increase in popularity as we adopt more and more tolerant practices and laws towards those that do not share our faith. We shall promote the spread and officially sanction mozarabic literature, music, cuisine and festivals to further spread the harmony and union of all the peoples that live within our realm."

We can see through their hatred and bigotry, and we realise that what they feel is envy. Here in the shores of the medditerranean sea, under the warm iberian sun, we have built a truly harmonized society. Christian, Muslim and even Jew all live, work, socialize and even sometimes, worship, together as one. The differences of religion, of prophets, to us in here are meaningless, together we are all free and equal. For the world might rave at us, but in here we realize, we are all sons and daughters of Abraham."

However, during the Solomonid Civil War, they joined with the usurpers against the Zagwe, weakening their position. During this time, the Ifat governors, joining forces with the Harar and the Agrobba, expanded and conquered territory across the plains into Zeila. Ifat became the dominant Muslim state, and the leader of Muslim thought in the region."
IFT_second: "Haqq al-Din's Rebellion"
IFT_second_desc: "By 1374, the Sultans were in open rebellion against the Zagwe Dynasty. The Ethiopian emperors were weak from their civil war, and could not afford to defend themselves from the Ifat Sultan's advances. In a crushing defeat, the Ifat armies marched into Lasta and defeated the Emperor in battle, forever crushing their authority. Now, Haqq al-Din's legacy is that of the conqueror of Christians, and the subjugators of Emperors."
IFT_third: "Fleet of Zeila"
IFT_third_desc: "The Bab El Mandeb is a key intersection between the Gulf of Aden and the Red Sea. From it, the lifeblood of the Ifat Sultanate flows - spice trade from the far east entering into the west. However, the Indian Ocean is a perilous sea, filled with pirates and rival powers standing in our way. Our fleet must stand strong in the face of these obstacles, never failing in their ever present mission to guard our seas."
IFT_fourth: "Seven Muslim States"
IFT_fourth_desc: "Prior to our meteoric rise, there were seven Muslim states in the Harla region. Dawaro, Arababni, Hadiyya, Shewa, Bali, Dara, and Ifat. We alone, however, remain. We have united the realm, gathered the muslim leaders to administer and run our state for the good of all of the community. We are united both in faith and in honor for our great kingdom."
IFT_fifth: "Domination of the Christians"
IFT_fifth_desc: "In the past, the Christian emperors of Zagwe would extort tribute out of us. If we failed to respond or offer tribute in return, we would be harrassed and invaded by their mighty armies. Now we have our swords to their knecks, holding them hostage with our might and authority. They shall pay what is owed to us or they shall be burnt in a holy fury."
IFT_sixth: "Agrobba Agriculture"
IFT_sixth_desc: "The Agrobba are a major ethnic group within our empire. They have grown from being merely a minor role in our state to being governors or lords of major provinces. They have survived in the Harari region using unique agriclutral techniqes that allow them to survive in the dry and arid region. The Erer River has been transformed into a farming hub thanks to their innovations in increasing crop yields and improving the quality of grain that has been placed there."

The fire of war has settled and now, in the halls of the university of Seville, the bright minds of Qurtubah continue this great legacy. The halls boom with the sound of exploding gunfire, the turn of clockwork metal, and the splashing of wood as it meets against the Al-Wadi I-Kabir river.

BJZ_ideas: "Al-Gharbian Ideas"
BJZ_ideas_start: "Al-Gharbian Traditions"
BJZ_ideas_bonus: "Al-Gharbian Ambition"
bjz_enemies_everywhere: "Enemies on all sides"
bjz_enemies_everywhere_desc: "Everywhere we look, we see enemies. Across our borders to the north, east and southeast, we are surrounded by those who wish to crush us. We shall not waver, through blood and steel we have earned our independence and with God on our side we shall resist until the bitter end."
bjz_bastion_sufism: "The Bastion of Sufism"
bjz_bastion_sufism_desc: "200 years ago, the great Abu I-Qasim Ahmad ibn al-Husayn ibn Qasi, led us, the Muridun in open rebellion against the Almoravid Sunnis; and altough we failed in the conquest against Al-Andalus we successfully defended and cemented our realm here in the lands between the Nahr Taj and Wadi Ana rivers. We have been watchful ever since, practicing our faith and serving as the true bastion of Sufism in Iberia. We must never waver, and from our castles we must always be watchful for our enemies across the rivers."
bjz_iberian_jihad: "The Iberian Jihad"
bjz_iberian_jihad_desc: "For too long we have cowered behind our walls and the rivers. We shall not tolerate any more raids, incursions or skirmishes. We have a right to exist, a right to our faith and we shall make sure every realm in Iberia knows this. The time has come to muster the garrisons, call upon the brave mujahideen and declare the Jihad for Iberia."
bjz_vast_fields: "The vast fields of Al-Gharb"
bjz_vast_fields_desc: "To those outside, it seems as if our lands between the Nahr Taj and Wadi Ana rivers are desolate, harid and rugged. They could not be further from the truth. The serene and vast plains of Al-Gharb are gentle, not hostile; and within their soil lies the potential to feed a nation of thousands but only if we tend to it. We shall encourage the creation of various farms and rural estates, where the peasantry will be hard at work to sow and reap the barley and wheat that shall feed our nation. All of course, under the careful watch of a garrison of course."
bjz_world_ends: "Here the World ends and the Sea begins"
bjz_world_ends_desc: "We stand upon the westernmost reaches of the known world. Farther from the holy cities than any other faithful can claim to (that we know of). This distance however does not need to be a melancholy for us to carry; for all arround us we see ships venturing from the ports and faraway into the horizon. The world is changing and if we wish to retain our place in it, we must adapt to it as well. The time has come to build a proper navy."
bjz_imam: "The Imam of Shilb"
bjz_imam_desc: "When he first rebelled ibn Qasi took the title of Imam of Shilb, and ever since then we have honored this legacy continuing the fight that he started. For as long as Al-Gharb has existed there has always been an Imam of Shilb to lead and guide us. The Imam is a rallying figure, our inspiration, our leader and as long as the walls of Shilb hold we shall always awnser his call."
bjz_unwavering_faith: "An Unwavering Faith"
bjz_unwavering_faith_desc: "We have been bruised and battered, but not beaten. Through our holy struggle we have remained, no, we have won. Iberia is ours for the taking and finally we can rest easy, pray and live, knowing no one else in this peninsula can ever disturb us again. The Imam of Shilb is proud and he cries, for he wishes that ibn Qasi could see what we have built of his legacy. We held truth to our faith and in turn, the almighty has rewarded us with peace and salvation."

#Sevillian Ideas
SEV_ideas: "Sevillian Ideas"
SEV_ideas_start: "Sevillian Traditions"
SEV_ideas_bonus: "Sevillian Ambition"
sev_the_seville_patricians: "The Patricians of Seville"
sev_the_seville_patricians_desc: "There is no doubt in all of Al-Andalus of who the real leaders and controllers of Seville are. For a long time now, the patricians of seville have amassed great wealth and built up and developed the city of Seville to become a true regional powerhouse. Into Seville flows the riches of Africa and Mediterranean, being the terminus of both the african gold route and the eastern silk route, Seville has grown rich indeed and anyone that wishes to hold domain over the city and the wealth it holds, nay, all of Iberia, will have to first face the patricians."
sev_protect_against_piracy: "Squash the raider insects"
sev_protect_against_piracy_desc: "Our prosperity is the envy of the west, and in the face of the inhability to face us directly, cowardly mosquitos from Africa and Majorca have taken it upon themselves to commander our cargo ships, and raid our coastline ports. This will not do, we shall squash these mere insects with haste."
sev_university_of_seville: "The University of Seville"
sev_university_of_seville_desc: "One of the greatest investments that the patricians have ever made, has been to expand the prestigious University of Seville. Already the bright minds of our city are returning a proffit on our investments with groundbreaking advacements and inventions in the field of gunpowder, shipbuilding, architecture and enginnering. We must continue to support this estemeed instituition."
sev_urbanism: "Sevillian Urbanism"
sev_urbanism_desc: "The growth and prosperity of our great city has not only led to an increase of its own borders and population, but also of other peripheral settlements and towns. It seems every day our city grows with newly arrived workers, merchants, craftsmen and others seeking a new life away from the toil and soil. An expansion of every urban settlement is in order, we will hire the best architects and develop a truly unique Sevillian style to our ever growing urban centers and its needs."
sev_berber_mercenaries: "Auxiliary Berber Mercenaries"
sev_berber_mercenaries_desc: "While we do not lack for wealth, we could never let ourselves be entirely reliant on a mercenary army. Instead we will hire berber companies from across Atlas, and use them to supplement our Munincipal Guards, in areas where shortage of manpower has become an issue."
sev_the_bank_of_iberia: "Sephardic Banking and Lending"
sev_the_bank_of_iberia_desc: "The Sephardic Jewish communities have long flourished here in Iberia, but there is no realm where they prosper quite like here in Seville. Famed for having become savy merchants and money lenders, we have built a symbiotic financial relationship with them. With the Sephardic community having lent us enough financial backing to make some of our more ambitious plans a reality, it is time to perhaps repay them. We shall sponsor the opening of a great Sephardic Iberian Bank here in Seville and leave it in the control of the Sephardic community. We have high hopes and dream of this one day becoming the bedrock and origin for a stable and responsible Iberian financial instituition."
sev_ever_upwards: "Ever Upwards"
sev_ever_upwards_desc: "There are some who think that wealth can only be attained when its directly brought from faraway places and back into home, but we know better. Why would you need to send vast fleets in search of gold, or luxuries, when instead you can wait and see them come to you? Seville has grown so prosperous that the goods of the world naturally flow into our ports, as such we do not need to expand in either direction, except up! Our cities grow rich and big, and we must match this prosperity, we must build higher, towards the heavens themselves. Onwards, ever upwards!"
