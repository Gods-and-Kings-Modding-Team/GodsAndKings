 cms_the_three_keys_desc: "Couto Misto is a union of the three vilages of Santiago, Rubiás and Meaus. Due to complicated manorial legalities we do not formally belong to any noble, king or clergym, instead the people of Couto Misto rule by themselves and elect a Juiz to serve as the leader and coordinate the necessaties of the three vilages and its peasantry. This judge is granted by the leaders of each village the three keys of our nation, granting him the legitimacy, trust and right to rule by the people and for the people."

 cms_freedom_from_tribute_desc: "Our defacto independence has given our people a variety of rights and priveleges that peasants in other neighboring realms can only dream of. Perhaps the most important of these is the right to be free from tribute or in other words, taxes. Our people do not pay any taxes, fees or any other sort of monetary restriction that is common in neighboring realms. This gives our peasantry an unheard of level of security and happyness, and altough it has meant the state has less resources to improve itself our people are no strangers to helping a friend and neighbor in need."

 tmm_heirs_ayutthaya: "Heirs of Ayutthaya"
 tmm_heirs_ayutthaya_desc: "The Uthong Dynasty, having been betrayed by the Suphannaphum during the Civil War of 1380, were left wide open during the invasion of Angkor. With no choice left, the Phra Ramesuan abandoned the capital and fled south to a fortified position in Si Thammarat. However, before he left, he ordered many treasures located within the city, religious texts, treasures, artists and performers, to be taken with him. In this sense, he had set up the new state as one to carry on the legacy of Ayutthaya, and carry on the cultural tradition of the once great city."
 tmm_naresuan: "Naresuan the Great"
 tmm_naresuan_desc: "Naresuan the Great, or known by his religious name, Sultan Naresuan Abdul Maalik Alkabir, was one of the Thai kings of legend. Coming to power in the year 1585, the man was raised under the watchful eye of the Imams and other scholars in the palaces of Lavo. By all accounts, the man was as dignified with reciting of the Quran as he was with running the country. However, his true passion lied in the planning and orchestrating of the armed forces. Even when he was young, he would play pretend soldier with his guards, ordering them to march in formation and have pretend battles against rival guards. When he finally rose to power, Naresuan was faced with a difficult situation. In the west, the Second Pagan Empire, led under the command of Narapati III, had finally subjected the Shan tribes in the hills, and used their new levies to attack the region of Lan Na, who had previously been under Naresuan’s mandala. Rallying the troops, the Thai king raced to the battlefield atop his elephant, and proceeded to lead the war from there. As the war raged on, eventually the conflict dragged out into localized warfare around the city of Chang Rai, where, in a stunning battle, the two kings met and did battle. With the will and strength of God behind him, Naresuan was able to defeat the Burmese king, ending the duel with a jab of his ngao. He would go down as one of the greatest sultans the Thai people have ever had."
 tmm_rebuilders_capital: "Rebuilders of the Capital"
 tmm_rebuilders_capital_desc: "The reconquest of Ayutthaya brought the Uthongs back to their ancestral home, however, it was not a warm welcome. The palace was ransacked, the farms burnt, the people shipped away, the capital was not what it once was. With the opportunity of a lifetime, to showcase legitimacy over Angkor and to sway smaller lords to return to the Thai dynasties, Ayutthaya began a massive reconstruction effort, slowly become more and more like the once great city it was - and with an influence from the West, thanks to inspired builders and architects, the capital gained a look reminiscent of classical Moorish architecture, and became known to many western traders as the Cordoba of the East."
 tmm_sassamedha: "Sassamedha Laws"
 tmm_sassamedha_desc: "The Thai kings, even before they became Islamized, were always tied to some sort of ruling. Even if it was not a legally binding set of rules, it was a form of guidelines that a lord must follow. Come the conversion to Islam, the Thai kings quickly molded the new faith’s rules and hadiths into their own style of rulings, and thus the idea of Sassamedha came to be; that a ruler must be able to know how to organize and distribute the food gained by the harvest effectively, so that he would resist the chance of famine or punishment from God."
 tmm_khattiya: "Khattiya Laws"
 tmm_khattiya_desc: "Likewise with the Sassamedha, the Kattiya was an idea that dictated the ability of the sultans to lead men in the fields of battle. With a corvee system akin to that of Dutch and Al-Andalus, the sultans began to train and recruit large swaths of soldiers both within the reach of the capital and from the various tributaries. With these armies, no heathen army would be able to stand against the rising Islamic power, not even those of the once great Angkor or Pagan."
 tmm_andalusian_tercio: "Al-Andalus Weaponry"
 tmm_andalusian_tercio_desc: "After the conversion of the Thai kings to the faith of Islam, they had begun to meet traders of a similar faith from across the seas. The Caliphs of Al-Andalus gave them warm welcomes and gifts from those far away lands, and in return, the Thai kings gave them friendly ports and housing for their traders, who brought with them the firearms of the west - weapons that the kingdoms could use with surprising effectiveness."
 tmm_islam_in_east: "Bastion of Islam in the East"
 tmm_islam_in_east_desc: "The Thai king Ramathibodi II, in the year 1443, had finally embraced the path of the true faith, after being convinced to convert by his many malaysian islamasized courtiers and advisors. Having declared the state to now be one of Islam, he still did not wish to harm or imprison those who he ruled over, as many Thai people still followed the faith of Buddhism, and paid homage to many of the thinkers in Sukhothai, Burma, and even Sri Lanka. In order to maintain his authority, the king molded Islam into a syncretic faith with the Buddhist one, integrating laws and concepts from both faiths into a brand new one. Thus, over time, the Thai people adopted this new faith, and, as the state slowly morphed into one centered around Islam at its core, now looked at its neighbours with a desire to convert and bring the path of the righteous and just to their people. With a blade in one hand, the Quran in another, with the ships from the west and the knowledge they carry in their cities, with artisan skill and military prowess that would make even the great warriors of Egypt take note, the Thai Sultans let out a cry from their terraces overlooking the great empire that they have created; “Mashallah!”"

 ank_rajakuti: "Rajakuti Diplomacy"
 ank_rajakuti_desc: "From the first Rajas at the birth of the Empire to the contemporary era, the great kings would build large structures across their empire, each being sites of prayer and worship. During the reign of Yasovarman I in 889, he had built over a hundred monasteries within the kingdom, each of them including something unique, the Rajakuti, or royal pavilions, areas in which nobles and princes would meet to relax in the warm dry season months. These monasteries built over 800 years ago have since fallen into disrepair, but as each king came to power, they would build more and more of them, leaving behind sanskrit inscriptions and tablets to mark their legacy down upon the these stone monuments. These monasteries, as the country moved into the modern era, became a hub for diplomatic missions for both foreign lords and ladies, but also internal disputes with local princes and chiefs. In that, the Rajakuti showcased the wealth of the king, who would decorate them with gold leaf and inscriptions of their long lineage of kings and their eventual absorption into their deity of choice; a sign of their ultimate power over this universe."
 ank_kshatriya: "Kshatriya Caste"
 ank_kshatriya_desc: "A staple of the Angkor Empire, was of course, the imported caste system from India. While it was far more rigid in the old continent, here there was an element of looseness to it, and that was clearest in the implementation of the warrior class called the Kshatriya. The class mostly defined by it being filled with nobles who led armies into war, they also had a role in being many of the king’s bodyguards and protectors - and for that task, they needed training and patience. Many of the Kshatriya would also be a part of the cult of Shaivism, which dictated practice of both a mastery of the body and mind, especially through yoga, in which some of the most elite members of this caste were shown to have a near perfect control of their own bodies in the activity. This discipline of the body translated onto the battlefield, when the soldiers of Lord Tribhavanadityvarman managed to withstand the Cham raid of 1165, with a mere squad of guards able to hold back over 5 junks worth of raiding ships. These soldiers were the best of the best for Angkor, and would show it time and time again on the battlefield."
 ank_laws_jayavarman_tenth: "Laws of Jayavarman X"
 ank_laws_jayavarman_tenth_desc: "The rule of the Lord Jayavarman X is one of both war and peace. He had come into power after his uncle, Sithean Reachee, died under mysterious circumstances in the year 1347. By the year 1380, had declared war on their old rival of Ayutthaya, finally capturing and sacking the magnificent city. However, problems were still abundant. He came to power only 13 years after a devastating raid by Champa in the year 1333. Their empire was littered with Mahayana monks attempting to convert the local populace. This created a problem for the lords of the region; already plagued by the question of religion, the state was now split even further - Theravadists in the west in the Chao Phraya basin, who once followed the Thai kings, now wished for the lord of Angkor to be a Chakravatin, not a Devaraja. The state Brahmins, who held significant sway over the kingdom ever since Srindrajayerman in 1308 emboldened their power in an attempt to make Hinduism the main faith of the Kingdom. Jayavarman X himself was a Hindu, but he still had to figure out how to save his realm from infighting and tearing itself apart. Thus, in the year 1394, Jayavarman X implemented reforms and modified the legal code, hoping to structure the state in a way to protect and benefit all peoples in his realm, allowing the divisions within the state to heal for a short time, but also to grant the rulers of the Empire the ability to more easily assert control in times of chaos and of great need. His decisions allowed for the Second Resurgence of Angkor, in which the old city had new life breathed into it, and created a new golden age for the empire."
 ank_expansion_angkor_wat: "Expansion of Angkor Wat"
 ank_expansion_angkor_wat_desc: "In 1382, Lord Jayavarman X began to completely remodel the capital in his own image. With the population brought over from Ayutthaya, and the wealth they provided, he managed to completely rework the failing infrastructure of the city. His next project was a new great work - not building a new temple, but instead refurbishing the massive complexes of Ankgor Wat. He attempted to remodel it away from its original design of worshiping Vishnu to instead worship Shiva, but most of the architecture and carvings remained the same, including the famous Churning of the Milk, a painting with Vishnu carved straight into the center. However, this rejuvenated city remained one of the largest cities in the entire world, rivaling that of Peking and dwarfing that of Pagan and Ayutthaya."
 ank_mekong_navy: "The Royal Mekong Navy"
 ank_mekong_navy_desc: "The Mekong Navy was originally a series of river junks, but through a series of kings ordering its creation and production throughout the 16th Century, by the time it was completed, the fleet was one of the largest in the region, dominating the Mekong river and even the Gulf of Khmer, dueling with the Srivijayan fleets in the infamous trade wars of the era - but not only that, during blockades by foreign powers such as the Yuan or even Albion, the Mekong Navy was known for their daring escapades and smuggling maneuvers to relieve sieges and evade capture."
 ank_expand_trade_malaya: "Expanding Malayan Trade"
 ank_expand_trade_malaya_desc: "At the height of the Angkor Empire, the extent to which their mandala reached was as far south as Ligor...yet, it never quite reached the Malay Peninsula. However, there was always a desire to spread their influence down there, and multiple kings had often decried chances lost to take the lands. Now, with Srivijaya out of Malaya, and the Thai kingdoms fractured and weak, the Angkor Empire looks at the squabbling Muslim states with greedy eyes, and drafted a series of merchant fleets to go and survey the land; were they gathering intel, were they preparing the ports for invasion, or were they simply there on a trade mission, only God knew. And the Devaraja knew all too well."
 ank_devaraja: "Rule of Devaraja"
 ank_devaraja_desc: "The Devaraja - a divine being on Earth. A ruler not only with the authority of the great god of Shiva or Vishnu, but who embodies, nay, inhabits the role of the god upon this world. Their legitimacy was holy, their path they tred transcendental. It was not one to be taken lightly: to prove the worth of a god one must build great works, and one must continually showcase their divinity. Before, in the ancient era of Angkor, the Devarajas were often bound by rules and rituals, and had to often answer to the Brahmins and their wishes. However, as time went on and the modern era began to creep in, the rulers of Angkor were able to sway the people to their side, and created a sort of Absolutist state, in which they had the supreme, divine authority from the day they were born until the day they died and were absorbed into the gods they claimed they represented. Should a king fail in his duties, and should they become weak and complacent and lose their way, they will fall and lose their way, and a more righteous man could overtake them. However, should they be able to secure their rule, even the mighty Bodhisattvas and Chakravatin will fear them - the Crown of Jasmine weighs heavily upon the head of mortal men, but not the Devaraja, for him it is light as a feather."

 srj_sailendra: "Sailendra Dynasty"
 srj_sailendra_desc: "The legacy of Srivijaya and the Sailendra dynasty traces itself far back, to before the city was even created, being one of the truly ancient dynasties of Sumatra and Java. Though many of their tales are lost to time, inscriptions and tablets left to showcase their glory remain. The mythical reign of the first Maharaja Santanu, who brought with him the traditions of father India, worshipping Shiva in all their glory. Further still, we recognize the Sailendras as the ones who curated and expanded the faith of Mahayana Buddhism throughout their empire - the practice of Yogacara across their empire was something done in their grand parks and palaces by princes and warriors alike. The legacy held firm throughout the crises of the last 300 years, from repelling the Chola invasions under Sangrama Vijayatunggavarman in 1030 to the rebellion and subsequent defeat of the Kediri Kingdom in eastern Java in 1224, to the Islamic revolution and revolt of Malaya in the 14th century. While the current kings might not quite be direct descendants of these legendary rulers, they still point to their great works and inscriptions much like a child would to their familial home - they seek to legitimize themselves, like the Maharajas of this modern era."
 srj_empire_water: "Empire of Water"
 srj_empire_water_desc: "Srivijaya exists because of the seal. It thrives because of its pathways and trade lanes, taking goods and knowledge from the Middle Kingdom and selling it to the western world on the ships of Arab merchants. The safe havens it provides in its ports allow for the Maharajas to collect tax and wealth, granting the empire the opportunity to grow and further increase control over the territories on the periphery. However, since the Malaya revolt in 1360, and the subsequent loss of territory in that region, traders from the Arab world now find comfort in that peninsula over the Sumatran or Javan ports, due to the religious safety that they can find in Muslim kingdoms. Thus, now more than ever, Srivijaya must maintain a strong navy, to not only protect and control the spice that flows in and out of the region, but also to reassert control over territories once owned by them."
 srj_siddhayarta: "Siddhayarta"
 srj_siddhayarta_desc: "In the ancient days of the early empire, the king Sri Jayanasa, who reigned in 671, was one of the lords who made Srivijaya what it is today - an empire spanning multiple islands. The man, as described by many foreign monks who visited Srivijaya, was a kind and generous one, who had built public parks not only for material beauty but also for the spiritual enrichment that could come from meditating in these new spaces. He was a man who was deeply involved within the Buddhist faith; He kept one of the great works of Asanga, the Yogacarabhumi-sastra, within his great halls, and his pranidhäna upon founding these parks dictated the need for spiritual enlightenment. He was a devout Mahayana Buddhist and sought to spread this wisdom across the seas. He began a great journey, or a Siddhayarta, over the Sunda straits and into Malaya and Java, spreading the power and glory of the empire into those neighboring lands, on both a political and spiritual quest. As he did so many years ago, his successors have made similar missions to conquer or colonize nearby lands, from the southern tip of Borneo to the attempted invasions of the Moluccas, and the many incursions into the Chao Phraya delta. Srivijayan Lords have a vested interest in expanding their holdings across these Buddhist lands, and they do not do it solely with soldiers and ships; they do it with prayer and meditation as well."
 srj_agamas: "Patronage of the Agamas"
 srj_agamas_desc: "The empire has long since been a multicultural hub of Buddhism - it was one of the original hubs of missionaries who would use its ports as a jumping-off point before they would sail to the lands of China, Angkor, and the various islands in the region. It patronized the Vajrayana school and welcomed its many pilgrims from across the globe, the monks of the Theravada doctrine would be safe within the walls of their monasteries, and the empire’s rulers themselves were heavily focused on Mahayana Buddhism, as its syncretic nature aided them in expanding and controlling new territories with heavily isolated and regionalized beliefs. This willingness to support the many doctrines of Buddhism granted stability within the realm as well as widespread prestige and honor - the home of Buddhism in Nusantara, if only rivaled by Angkor to the north. While this patronage did not extend to other faiths entirely, such as Islam and Christianity, this policy did prevent rebellion and uprising within the islands of Java and Sumatra when otherwise they would have collapsed."
 srj_hegemony_straits: "Hegemony of the Straits"
 srj_hegemony_straits_desc: "Since the initial push by Sri Jayanasa, the Srivijayan Empire had a near-complete hegemony of the Straits of Malacca, controlling the incoming and outgoing trade. This was maintained by the Mandala System, a governmental style that was notable due to its focus of a strong central authority near the capital city, and one which waned in influence the farther away a territory was - and with the capital being right on the straits, they were able to maintain that grip more effectively, and with smaller tributary kingdoms up and down Sumatra, Java, and formerly in Malaya, they could extend that control down the trade winds. While the loss of Malaya and Borneo would prove detrimental to trade and power in the region, they are still one of the few kingdoms capable of exerting their influence and status on the straits."
 srj_borobudur: "Borobudur"
 srj_borobudur_desc: "In the Kedu Valley, underneath an active volcano, lies the massive complex of Borobudur, the second largest Buddhist temple in the world. Built-in the 9th Century, this temple was created throughout the reign of three great monarchs, Dharanindra, Samaragrawira, and Samaratungga, all of who poured an incredible amount of manpower and wealth into the project, attempting to make it the ultimate temple in the Nusantara. The temple’s architecture was meant to symbolize many of the core elements and themes of Buddhism; the lotus flower layout and the ten mounting terraces reflect the Boddhivista’s journey to reach enlightenment, the large bell-shaped dome at the top of the terraces merging with the mountainside showcasing exemplary classical Buddhist architecture, a style that would be replicated from Siam to Burma in the centuries to come. Pilgrims of all Buddhist sects would flock to the kingdom, hoping to see the glory in its design and take part in meditation or prayer. It was more than just a temple as well, as time went on, it became a symbol of pride and power for the Sailendra Dynasty.  As the kingdom furthered its control and shifted away from the strict thalassocracy that it was for a more traditional empire, many of its newfound riches were put into place in expanding and developing the site, making it even more wonderful and fantastical than ever before. In 1208, the first Maharaja was crowned in Borobudur, and even still to this day, the lords of the land are still enthroned in the shade of the temple."
 srj_lela: "The Lela"
 srj_lela_desc: "After the failed Mongol invasion in the 13th Century, the use of gunpowder within Srivijaya became commonplace. The cetbang, a Javanese style Lela, was first put to use by the Majapahit kingdom striking out in rebellion against the Srivijayans, and while the rebellion was crushed, the Maharaja at the time adopted the technology and began to implement them on their cannons on their large junk and the walls of their great cities. These Lela were in such widespread use that, by the time the Europeans arrived in Nusantara, the inhabitants were using weapons of a similar quality to those of the foreigners."

Not since House Otto has a royal lineage had such a tight grip on the imperial office. It was originally the policy of Prezemysl II to persue alliances and marriages within the Empire - one that eventually proved successful by forming deep and intricate webs of loyalties and friendships."
 POL_ideas_mr_2: "Imperial Frontier"
 POL_ideas_mr_2_desc: "Poland occupies a land that was once considered beyond the eastern border of the Empire; ironically, Krakow and it's direct crownlands are now prosperous heartlands. Mongol raids, pagan banditry, invaders from the Rus... These threats have tempered our men and kept them prepared, ready to rally to the defense of our lands."
 POL_ideas_mr_3: "Będąc w Rzymie, Czyń jak Rzymianie"
 POL_ideas_mr_3_desc: "Being within - or more appropriately - atop the Empire means talking, a lot of talking. Whether it be the language of the Germans, the Latins, the French, or even The Church, being able to schmooze and negotiate in their tounge will undoubtedly make things easier. Its unlikely people will be clamoring to learn Polish anyway.\n\n`When in Rome, Do as the Romans do.`"
 POL_ideas_mr_4: "Cudzodziemski Autorament"
 POL_ideas_mr_4_desc: "Foreign units and auxillaries have been integrated in militaries the world over for centuries; wealth and stability have brought communities of people from all over Europe to settle in Poland. In fact, those who call this land their new home are just as keen to fight for it as any other Pole. Expanding recruitment standards to allow these new settlers can only bolster our forces; perhaps even bringing new and specific skills that we can learn."
 POL_ideas_mr_5: "Komisja Edukacji Narodowej"
 POL_ideas_mr_5_desc: "As the first Ministry of Education in Europe, this Polish institution was visionary for its time. Originally it was meant to detach the education of Polish scholars from the influence of the Church, which the nobility of Poland foresaw this as a threat to crown soverignty. Eventually the system was expanded to ecompass universities throughout - and sometimes - beyond Poland."
 POL_ideas_mr_6: "Reorganized Choragiew"
 POL_ideas_mr_6_desc: "Even since the rule of Mieszko I, cavalry has played an integral role in the Polish military. Choragiew, literally 'banner', are the main division of units of these cavalry. Choragiew are further sub classified into District Choragiew, Clan Choragiew, and Court Choragiew; formed by knights of a district, clans, and troops of the King, respectively."
 POL_ideas_mr_7: "Rebuild the Villages"
 POL_ideas_mr_7_desc: "After treaties are drawn up and executed, the fighting concludes, but the work does not. Soldiers returning home are continued to be paid for the work of going from town to town rebuilding and replanting lost produce. This was in fact a declaration for humanitarian purpose, but serves a double purpose of fostering good favor with subjects of the crown."
