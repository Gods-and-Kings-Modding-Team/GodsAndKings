 cms_harvest_season_title: "Harvest Season"
 cms_harvest_season_desc: "Autumn is coming to an end, and with it the villagers bring the bounty of our free land into both their pantries and into the communal stockpile. There's a chill in the air though. A small thought, an instinct seems to have overtaken all of us and our Juiz ponders...soon enough everything will change, and we must be ready for whatever fate has in store. For now though we celebrate and party to this years hardwork. Saude!"
 cms_trinity_church_title: "The opening of Trinity Church"
 cms_trinity_church_desc: "For years we lacked a central church, but that has come to an end. Thanks to donations and volunteering from Mistelos, the aptly named Igreja da Trindade has been opened. This new structure will fullfill the spiritual needs of our peasantry. As well as serving as a rallying point and public spot for other communal uses, if need be. "
 cms_militia_commander_title: "Elect a Militia Commander"
 cms_militia_commander_desc: "Altough every peasant in couto misto is highly encouraged to own weapons and defend their own land and homes, we are in dire need of military leadership of some sort. The time has come for the peasants to come together and elect one of us to become field commander and lead the peasantry against any who dares to oppress us."
 cms_portuguese_cavaleiro_title: "Invite a Cavaleiro"
 cms_portuguese_cavaleiro_desc: "Portugal has made great advancements in war, and none is as impressive as their Cavaleiros. We'll invite one to come to Couto Misto and teach us, so that we might improve our militia. Only issue will be stopping the peasants from throwing rocks and insults at the noble born cavaleiro. Maybe offer a ham to each family as long as they swear to behave themselves...yes that works. Who doesn't like ham? "
 cms_peasant_family_connections_title: "Extended Peasant Ties"
 cms_peasant_family_connections_desc: "It's no secret that peasant families are often quite large. Being so large means that many of our own families have ties, either of blood or marriage, to other peasant families and groups spread across northwestern Iberia. We should make use of these ties to better assert our independence and spread our way of life."
 cms_basque_investment_title: "Basque Investments"
 cms_basque_investment_desc: "No realm in Iberia has become as rich as that of Navarra. The basque people are overflowing with gold, either from their goods production or from the rising profits of whaling. We could never compete with them economically, but perhaps we could strike a deal with a independent minded merchant. Guns and weapons from couto misto in exchange for a steady supply of iron, perhaps?"
 cms_popular_assembly_title: "The 313th Assembly"
 cms_popular_assembly_desc: "The time has come to convene the yearly Assembly of Couto Misto. It is when every peasant in our realm gathers together, and through popular voting we decide the focus of our resources. This year however will be special, we'll gather all of the peasantry inside the Trinity Church. Our Juiz will seat in a raised platform at the center of the church, moderating the debates and counting the votes, while below and surrounding him in a circle, will be the entire peasantry. In the house of the lord, we shall be respectful of one another and walk together in unity towards liberation."

 #Galician Missions#
 gal_rebellious_son_title: "Our Rebellious Son"
 gal_rebellious_son_desc: "There was a time when the Portuguese kingdom was but a mere duchy, subservient to the crown of Galicia and Leon. That was until the rebellious son of Queen Tareixa de León, Dom Afonso Henriques declared independence for his duchy. Much has changed since those times, the line of Borgoña still rules Portugal, while we have shed away from noble control. We must end the animosity between our realms, either by diplomacy or through war. "
 gal_cement_our_independence_title: "Cement our Independence"
 gal_cement_our_independence_desc: "The Leonese-Castilian civil war has given us a unique window of opportunity to once again assert our independence. Perhaps it would be wise to choose a side to aid, surely then whoever we support would be in our debt and respect our right for self determination, right?"
 gal_papal_connection_title: "Papal Connections"
 gal_papal_connection_desc: "There's no denying the influence and importance that Santiago (and Galicia by extension) has in the catholic world. Whatever may come, the bishop of Santiago will always remain an important figure both domestically and abroad. We shall make use of his religious influence and nudge the Holy See to give us the support we so rightfully deserve from our position."
 gal_renovate_santiago_title: "Renovate Santiago"
 gal_renovate_santiago_desc: "The grand cathedral of Santiago de Compostela is our greatest pride and joy. It is the beating heart of galicia, and as such we must make sure that it always reflects the splendor of our realm. We shall renovate it and make it grander than any other pilgrim destination in the christian world."
 gal_burgo_economic_oversight_title: "Dominance of the Burgos"
 gal_burgo_economic_oversight_desc: "No other group has risen to prominence in Galicia as quickly as the urban Burgos. Our economy is all but dominated by these rich merchants and craftsmen, however this doesn't need to be a bad thing. The burgos are exceptional and talented, by giving them key positions in financial matter of our government we will reap the economic rewards, while also making sure our Bishop is untroubled and untempted by the corrupting alure of gold. "
 gal_burgo_markets_title: " Burgo Street Markets"
 gal_burgo_markets_desc: "The burgo have started an initiative of popular street markets and fairs. Once a week, our city streets are flooded with various stalls and tents of merchants, farmers, peasants and craftsmen. All competing with one another trying to sell their goods to visitors, pilgrims and city natives. These weekly markets have caused an explosion of city growth and revenue, as now even peasants from the countryside flood the city, to spend the day searching for bargains and an oportunity to better their life."
 gal_militia_exercises_title: "Muster the Militias"
 gal_militia_exercises_desc: "When we achieved independence, we did so with the diplomatic power and influence of the bishop, and the resources and funding of the burgos. One of the conditions of our coexistence, is that the matters of the army are left up to the burgos control. As such instead of relying on a levy or feudal army, the burgos have organized our defense through a system of communal militias and volunteer groups. All we can do is call upon the militias, but where they go and what they do for the realms defense, will be up to the burgos."
 gal_sell_army_commision_title: "Sell Army Commisions"
 gal_sell_army_commision_desc: "Sensing yet another opportunity to make a proffit, it seems the burgos have begun to sell off the position of commander and military officers to the highest bidder. Leading the ranks of the peasant and urban militias are now either wealhty merchants seeking to make a name for themselves, or embittered nobles looking to regain any semblance of relevance or control in our realm. Surely, this can only end well."
 gal_autonomous_communities_title: "Autonomous Communities"
 gal_autonomous_communities_desc: "Back when we were a kingdom, Galicia was dotted with various autonomous communities in both cities and in rural villages. Indeed the burgos themselves came to power through these autonomous cities. Now though by Burgo decree almost every city and village is autonomous and independent. Some faraway villages in mountains and valleys are perhaps a bit...too independent. We must bring these communities back to heel and remind them that altough autonomous they are still galician!"
 gal_la_coruna_title: "A Coruña"
 gal_la_coruna_desc: "There is no disputing that Santiago is the heart of Galicia, but if it is the heart, then the Coruña is fast becoming the brain. Settled by the coast, this once small city has recently exploded in size and population, thanks to Burgo management and investment. Indeed it now even rivals even our seat of Santiago. A concerning development, or a boon to the realm we wonder."
 gal_pilgrim_trap_title: "The Pilgrim Trap"
 gal_pilgrim_trap_desc: "We can no longer deny ourselves. The allure of gold, its too much to bear. The burgos grow so rich and powerful and what do we have? The tithe? Forget the piety, forgo your fears, for we shall grow rich too! Pilgrims flood the streets of Santiago, no, they flood the country, and they are desperate for salvation and enlightment! We shall give it to them...for a price of course. Sell relics, tax the pilgrims, sell indulgences and divorce papers, put toll booths every step of the way, give them everything and take everything from them. Oh the gold, the gold! Lord forgive me...wait, I can just buy myself an indulgence!"

#Navarra Missions#
 nav_galicias_son_title: "The Son of Galicia"
 nav_galicias_son_desc: "The Portuguese Kingdom has been led for almost 300 years by the House of Bourgone. This house has enjoyed a stable and clear line of sucession all the way since the Kingdom's founder "Dom Afonso Henriques I". Now however, for the first time in their history Portugal has no heir. The aging King Francisco de Borgonha only has a daughter, whom he refuses to declare as his heir on the grounds of tradition. We must take advantage of this, we will convince King Francisco to marry off his daughter to one of our cousins."
 nav_tame_fanatics_title: "Tame the Fanatics"
 nav_tame_fanatics_desc: "Now that we have dynastic control over the realm of Portugal, the time has come to pull the favors over our cousin and properly integrate Portugal into our cadre of vassals, same as Aragon and Catalonia. The fanatical armies of the Portuguese will serve us nicely in our effort towards unifying all of Iberia under a common banner."
 nav_to_santiago_title: "On the way to Santiago"
 nav_to_santiago_desc: "A union with Leon and a war with the emerging kingdom of Portugal left Galicia as a humbled vassal, until fairly recently. With the wealth of the city peasants, the burgos, and the influence of the Bishop of Santiago, Galicia has become independent again. The wealthy burgos have near complete control over the economy and the army but the bishop is not fully toothless (at least not in spirit). We will send the bishop an offer, if he accepts to become our vassal we will use our armies to crush the burgo militias and in exchange give full control over the realm of Galicia to the bishop."
 nav_asturian_legacy_title: "The Asturian Legacy"
 nav_asturian_legacy_desc: "Iberian Christendom was once united under the Kingdom of Asturias, but those times are gone. Now christian fights against christian, brother against brother and this couldn't be exemplified better than in the rivalry of Leon and Castile. Both fight and dream over holding hegemony in Iberia, a dream that is dashed by each other's continued existence. We will break up this senseless brotherly infighting, either they will both stand down peacefully, or we will march and force them to stop. Regardless, once this is done we alone will hold the legacy of Asturias. For there can be only one."
 nav_covadonga_title: "The Court of Covadonga"
 nav_covadonga_desc: "Once more Christian Iberia is unified, but not all our subjects are pleased. Grievances, feuds and rivalries continue to flare up and we need to give them an outlet for peaceful resolution. We will establish in the village of Covadonga a great legal court. This permanent court will be tasked with handling high profile cases between our realms and vassals. From now on, any disagreement in Iberia will be solved in the court and not in the battlefield."
 nav_court_hopping_title: "Iberian Courier Service"
 nav_court_hopping_desc: "Iberia is rather large, and considering the autonomy that our vassals hold, our basque diplomats are always busy hopping from one regional court to another. This system is rather ineffecient, so instead we shall establish a new "Iberian Courier Service". An instituition of dedicated regional couriers and postmen, that together with a revamp of our main roads will be able to deliver with speed and efficiency, any manner of news, letters and information from our various vassal courts in the edges of Iberia, back towards Navarra and Olito."
 nav_prepare_levy_title: "Reform the Feudal Levy"
 nav_prepare_levy_desc: ""No,no,no...this certainly won't do." King Carlos is rather upset at the state of the nations levy. For the dream of Iberia to be achieved, we will require a major reform. Away from the traditional feudal mustering, and towards the establishment of a professional, permanent fighting force. Perhaps we could contact the captains of the Navarrese Mercenary Company and ask them for help. "As good a place to start as any, I supose.""
 nav_walls_of_navarra_title: "The Royal Palace of Olite"
 nav_walls_of_navarra_desc: "Deep within Navarra, lies the city of Olite and even deeper into it, the great palace of Olite. The Palace is the center of our realm, it is where our King resides and where the Navarran cortes are established. The castle is a mastery and example of gothic architecture, with some foreign dignatiries even regarding it as something out of a fairy tale. However as beautiful as it is, the castle is in dire need of modernized defenses. \nWe will upgrade many of the outlying structures and fortifications and when we are done, our home will not only be regarded as a fairy tale dream, but also an aggressors nightmare."
 nav_aragon_reconquista_title: "The Aragonese Reconquista"
 nav_aragon_reconquista_desc: "While we are quite content with ruling over Navarra, our vassals and subjects are not so amicable to the Iberian status quo. The nobles of Aragon in particular have petitioned the King and the Cortes multiple times for their various claims over Qurtubah and Balansiya to be pressed. While normally they would have been rejected, it seems that King Carlo's recent...awakening of ambition, has led to a passionate speech before the cortes, with the King lending his support for the Aragonese. Already the newly reformed armies are being prepared, and deployed for the reconquista of Valencia by Aragon."
 nav_unleash_fanatics_title: "Unleash the Portuguese"
 nav_unleash_fanatics_desc: "No kingdom in Iberia is quite as zealous and fanatical as the Portuguese. The mere mention and thought over a holy war and conflict seems to drive them towards an insatiable bloodlust. While this could become a problem in the future for our Iberian ambitions, we are quite content and glad to simply let them loose over the Qurtubhans for now. Just to make them bleed a little bit and open their minds to more...peaceful resolutions."
 nav_show_mercy_cordoba_title: "Show mercy to Qurtubah"
 nav_show_mercy_cordoba_desc: "There is no denying the influence and strength Qurtubah holds, out of everyone in Iberia they are the only ones we would truly dare to call equals. Within the Cortes and among our vassals, there are cries and claims for us to strike them and end them for good. A war with Qurtubah would be a long, and hardous affair though. Not to mention the bad blood that would remain within Southern Iberia. \nNo, we will try another way. We will reach out for them, we will respect their customs, honor their laws and religion; and all we ask in return is for the Emir to recognize Navarra as his sovereign."
 nav_keys_of_cordoba_title: "The Keys of Qurtubah"
 nav_keys_of_cordoba_desc: "The Emir of Qurtubah met with the King of Navarra in the center of the city of Cordoba in a grand celebration. \nThe ceremony was attended by the greatest representatives from across Iberia and an audience of thousands. It started with the Emir kneeling before the King and presenting him with the keys of the city's gates. However instead of reaching for the keys, the King reached for the Emir's hand, holding both it and the keys as he pulled him upwards, and as the Emir and the King stood side by side they raised their shared handshake. Both holding onto the keys as the king yelled "Peace!" \nAfter centuries of war and devastation at last, the reconquista has ended."
 nav_secure_heir_title: "In my dream, I saw a whale"
 nav_secure_heir_desc: ""It was golden and it swam in an ocean of black water and upon the whale, was a great city with a hovering crown of iron. Wherever the whale passed, every animal and being bowed down to it, and then I heard it singing. Its name, was Iberia." \nKing Carlos has been beset by a strange vision, and a newfound obsession. He claims to the cortes, that it is Navarra's destiny to finally unite all of Iberia, to end the reconquista, to end war and misery. It will be a massive undertaking, one that will require us to be both savy diplomats, and cunning generals but Carlos claims we are capable of it, and the King always seemed to have a way with words...so be it. The hunt for the golden whale, shall begin.""
 nav_aragon_nobility_title: "Little Nobles of Aragon"
 nav_aragon_nobility_desc: "To even conceive of starting our plans for Iberia, we must first deal with the subjects that already swear fealty to us. \nThe realm of Aragon passed into our control once King Carlos grandfather, Sancho the Strong fought for his claim on the Aragonese throne, after the late James I the Crusader died in the great Cathar French Crusade. Ever since then we have consolidated the high nobles of aragon with a mix of marriages, concessions and court positions in order to secure their loyalty to their new overlords. However, we have for too long neglected the lower aragonese nobility. These regional barons, counts and even some dukes have recently started to stoke the fire of rebellion, expousing nonsensical concepts and garble like "Aragonese nationality", and "regional autonomy". We will fix this by giving these regional nobles a direct channel and outlet to the king, in order to resolve their grievances."
 nav_catalonia_merchants_title: "The Merchants of Catalonia"
 nav_catalonia_merchants_desc: "With the union over Aragon came also the union over the lands of Catalonia. A land where the sway of the nobility was almost non-existent, and instead the merchants and guilds of Barcelona were and still are king. What Barcelona decrees the rest of Catalonia follows, and what Barcelona desires above all else is gold and prosperity. \nWhile we could try to merely impose our will over the merchants, King Carlos says this would be rather inneficient and a waste of potential.\nInstead we will use the expertise of the merchants of Catalonia by employing them and hiring them as bureucrats and admnistrators in our realm. We will also give control of our finances over to them, letting them oversee the wealth and prosperity of the kingdom. This should both fullfill their monetary ambitions and provide us with a stable, and reliable financial bedrock for our Iberian dream."
 nav_bearn_clergy_title: "Bright Bearn Monks"
 nav_bearn_clergy_desc: "The vassalage of Bearn has been a very recent affair. Having occured only a few years ago, the catholic monks of Bearn requested our protection and aid in fighting against the entrenched local Waldensian heretics. It has been hardwork, as the Waldensians keep retreating further and further into secret communities in hidden caves, peaks, valleys and forests dotted all throughout the Pyrenees. \nWe must put an end to their blaspheming, by showing the Bearn clergy we are capable of stomping even the most entrenched heretic, perhaps we could convince other local southern french vassals and realms to join us. \nAfter all, the french have clearly failed in their struggle against the Cathars, and if the french can't defeat them, then we must pick up the slack." 
 nav_forward_watchposts_title: "The Gates of Iberia"
 nav_forward_watchposts_desc: "While the Pyrenees offer us an exceptional natural defensive border with the rest of Europe, we should not have to be content with it being our first line of defense. \nBy using the pretense of fighting heresy in southern france, we could move in to the Cathar heartlands of Toulouse, routing the heretics and occupying their mighty fortress of Carcassone. With it under our control we could set up various outposts along the Garonne river into Bordeaux, which would give us not just, uncontested economic control over southern france, but would also pre-empt anyone in Europe from interfering in our Iberian ambitions."
 nav_misto_peasants_title: "The Andorran Fortress"
 nav_misto_peasants_desc: "The little community of Andorra la Vieja is a strange oddity, not just in Iberia but in all of Europe. \nA realm dating back to the times of Charlemagne and whose official Head of State is a duality of both the Bishop of Urgell in Catalonia and the King of France. For a long time we have chosen to merely ignore this little independent community, but as our Iberian ambitions grow we must start to take steps to properly integrate them into our wider realm. \nWhile we could very easily do a show of force, this is rather unnecessary, not to mention mean spirited for such a small community. Instead we will offer to protect their status and autonomy in our realm, as well as giving them a place of honor by establishing the "Andorran Border Guard". A company of all Andorran serving guardsmen to patrol and protect the pyrenees against would be invaders and criminals. Just as long as they replace the French Co-Prince with a Navarran one of course."
 nav_iberian_federation_title: "The Iberian Federation"
 nav_iberian_federation_desc: "Finally, after struggle, sweat and toil all of Iberia is under our control. The time has come to convene the Cortes, invite representatives from our vassals and to finally, fullfill King Carlos dream and make Iberia a reality. \nWherever our blessed King is, we hope he can see what we have achieved and that he is proud that we have made his dream a reality."
 nav_expanded_cortes_title: "Expand the Cortes"
 nav_expanded_cortes_desc: "The growth of Iberia and the ever ongoing integration of our former vassal realms into the government apparatus, has demanded that we expand the seats on the Cortes to accomodate the various new regions that join our great Federation. On the upside of this however, the new cortes members are quite energetic and ambitious. They have seemingly filled the instituition with a newfound zeal and drive, allowing the governance of the state to be much more effective and flexible than it had been in these last couple decades."
 nav_naval_funding_title: "Naval Funding"
 nav_naval_funding_desc: "Our navy and merchant fleet is in an awful state. If we wish to go somewhere, anywhere, we need to first fix this disaster. \nWe will set up more funds for the Basque navy, for it is honestly just embarrasing we even let it come to this."
 nav_royal_nau_title: "The Royal Karrakak"
 nav_royal_nau_desc: "Our naval buildup is nearly complete, and our initial wave of marines is almost finished with their training but we are still missing a vital piece in our arsenal. We need a flagship, a great heavy command center in the ocean, that our newly constructed fleet can rally behind and follow into the darkest abyssal depths. \nWe will spare no expense, this Karrakak will be pride of our nation and with it leading our fleet we shall never be defeated in a naval battle!"
 nav_basque_marines_title: "Create the Basque Marines"
 nav_basque_marines_desc: "Our nation has no shortage of seasoned and experienced sailors. As such, one of our newly promoted admirals has come with an interesting proposal. One to tackle both the issue of our army reform and the buildup of a proper state navy. \nWe will create the Royal Basque Marines a dedicated force of elite sailors and veteran whalers who will act as the land branch of our navy. Fully able to fullfill the role of both sailor and soldier, wherever we need them."
 nav_integrate_catalonia_title: "Integrate Merchant Fleet"
 nav_integrate_catalonia_desc: "Now that we proven ourselves towards our Catalonian admnistrators and financeers, we have been able to negotiate a deal where we will be able to control and direct a portion of the Catalonian Merchant Fleet and use it for whatever goals the crown has in mind. Provided we pay the agreed upon subsidy, maintenance and repairs for the fleet while it's under our control...Actually, I'm starting to think we got scammed."
 nav_redirect_trade_title: "Redirect Trade to Barcelona"
 nav_redirect_trade_desc: "With the Catalonians becoming an ever increasingly important part of our government, we have found ourselves seeing their own ambitions as ours. \nAmong these Catalonian ambitions is that to control the flow of trade and riches from the mediterranean. While we aren't exactly in a position to control the wealth from Italy or Greece, we can focus our efforts towards the trade that flows into Seville and relocate the terminus towards Barcelona instead."
 nav_mozarabic_nautics_title: "Moor Sail Developments"
 nav_mozarabic_nautics_desc: "With the control and integration of Cordoba, has also come the various innovations and research that had been conducted by the muslims. Among the most promissing of all the inventions that have come out from the University of Seville has been the Moor Sail, a triangular canvas that once attached to a small or medium sized vessel, allows it unimaginable amounts of control and maneuverability over the winds. \nThis sail has the potential to enable a vessel to reliably venture into the farthest depths of the ocean and return alive! We must take use of this innovations immediatly, and fund greater developments to fit it into larger hull ships."
 nav_a_new_world_title: "A Whole New World"
 nav_a_new_world_desc: "In seaside taverns and docks, rumors and stories spread. Seasoned sailors and whalers tell stories of faraway lands across the sea, of verdant islands and cyan colored waters, of massive bounties of fish, of strange crying birds and strangers with odd vestments and languages. Already these long tales have captured the imagination of our people, and hundreds brave out into the sea to find these fabled paradises. Perhaps, just, perhaps it could be worth it to look into an investigation of our own."
 nav_terranova_title: "Terranova"
 nav_bay_of_plenty_title: "Settle the Bay of Plenty"
 nav_bay_of_plenty_desc:"The tales were true. Across the sea in a land we have called the bay of plenty, lies a stretch of ocean filled with unimaginable amounts of fish and, whales. We must establish outposts immediately, the riches of the sea lie just within our grasp!"
 nav_eel_lair_title: "The Eeel's lair"
 nav_eel_lair_desc: "A most peculiar discovery has been made by one of our whaler vessels. While on a journey from the Bay of Plenty towards the Azores, the ship travelled through an area of the Atlantic we call the "Sargassos Sea" and on it, just barely below the surface waters, a truly hellish picture revealed itself to the crew. Hundreds, no, thousands of young eels dotted the water. There were so many infact, the captain claimed the sea was more eel than it was water. Since the encounter, fishermen together with students from the University of Seville have been sent to witness the strange phenomenon and have determined that this portion of the ocean is the birthplace of every eel in the world. We must take advantage of this discovery and monopolize the eel trade."
 nav_hellish_paradise_title: "Hellish Paradise"
 nav_hellish_paradise_desc: "The Central Reisland Isles are a true paradise. Cyan colored warm water breaks against pristine soft sands, exotic and delicious sweet fruit trees grow in abundance everywhere, and the warm clear sky welcomes us everyday with a comforting glow. \nOne would truly think it a paradise, were it not for the constant sound of the cracking whips, the cries of our plantation workers and the neverending suffering and toil that the cashcrops have brought to this land. Our clergy says it's abhorrent, unchristian and that we will be judged by God for allowing such suffering to befall on our lands but the truth is, these plantations bring us quite a large degree of wealth. \nPerhaps it would be best to limit acess to this, hellish paradise, keep our whalers, our clergy and anyone else except for the planters, the slavers and workers from being able to dock into the isles. Out of sight out of mind, they will be much happier not knowing where their cotton, tobacco, coffee or sugar comes from."
 nav_even_further_beyond_title: "To go even further beyond!"
 nav_even_further_beyond_desc: "We have come far from the Bay of Bizkaya, we have evolved from the mountainous Kingdom of Navarra, to a true Iberian Federation, to a grand global empire. Now we must push ourselves further. This, is to go, even further beyond!"
 nav_blue_whale_hunting_title: "A Kindred Kingdom"
 nav_blue_whale_hunting_desc: "The occean currents and winds have brought us to a strange land, but with a familiar people. The Kingdom of Hawaii is remarkable and in many aspects, very much like our own. The native hawaiian people are expert seamen, navigators and shipwrights, indeed we must admit our own whalers and marines have created a sort of affinity and kinship with these people. We must reach out for the Hawaiin king and convince him to join our great federation. We would be honored to have such a kindred kingdom, and sail brothers withint our ranks."
 nav_orca_hunting_title: "Frontier of Reality"
 nav_orca_hunting_desc: "Our people are pioneers like no other. Our whalers know no bounds, as they chase the prized whales to every corner of the world, and into the frontier of reality itself. Although the riches always find their way back to our ports, we must admit our grip and control over the farthest frontiers is quite loose. This has somehow become appealing to some within our realm, as an influx of freedom seeking adventurers now flood out into the frontier, often disappearing from the settlements into the wilds, and off of reality itself (As far as we are concerned)."
 nav_sperm_whale_hunting_title: "A World of Whaling"
 nav_sperm_whale_hunting_desc: "From the Bay of Bizkaya, to the Bay of Plenty. From frozen Greenland, to stormy Anti-Atlas. From distant Taiwan, to even further Aotearoa. We have chased the great whale over every region and wave of this great world. Empires may claim dominion over each other and their lands, but for us, our dominion is that of the water. For wherever is a whale, there is a basque.\nThrough determination, courage and bravery we have tamed the ocean, and turned it into a whalers world."
 nav_world_class_mariners_title: "World Class Mariners"
 nav_world_class_mariners_desc: "The Royal Basque Marines have become the most prestigious and feared branch of our entire military. Renowed for their hardyness, discipline and organization, it seems that every young boy in Iberia dreams of one day joining the Royal Basque Marines and go on adventures across the sea. \nWe shouldn't have to shatter their dreams, we have restricted promissing young men from joining the Marine Ranks for far too long. We shall open up positions to any Iberian and transfrom the Royal Basque Marines, into the Federal Iberian Marines."
 nav_abyss_stared_back_title: "The Abyss Stared Back"
 nav_abyss_stared_back_desc: "We have gone too far. The abyss has stared back."
 nav_coastal_fish_markets_title: "Coastal Fish Markets"
 nav_coastal_fish_markets_desc: "The Coast of Navarra is home to a multitude of fishing and whaling communities. That, combined with our fishermen's ability to traverse the Bay of Biskaya and enter into French and Castillian markets gives our peasantry the opportunity to grow rather rich. \nWe will incentivize this economy even further by sponsoring the opening of dedicated marketplaces in these coastal towns, for the sale and trading of the bounties of the sea."
 nav_whalers_of_bizkaia_title: " The Whalers of Bizkaia"
 nav_whalers_of_bizkaia_desc: "When it comes to whaling, navarra is the best in the entire world, but the best of the best hail from Bizkaia. The bizkaia whalers are legendary for their prowess, effeciency and bravery. \nOnce a whale is spotted by the permanent town watchmen, the bell is rung and the bizkaia whalers rush to their sloops where they then chase the whale until their prize is caught. It is an art to itself of dedication and determination. We will invest in this community and build it up so it can become the true whaling hub from where all of our projects for whaling expeditions and ventures can depart from."
 nav_integrate_whalers_title: "Whalers into Marines"
 nav_integrate_whalers_desc: "Whalers are the best of our society. Brave, resourceful, and unflinching. Veteran whalers will make the perfect candidates for our Marine program. \nWe will open it up to any basque whaler that no longer wishes to engage in the whale hunt, and would rather be on a steady payroll. We will also open the program for any whaler that is too old or potentially retired, as even the valuable experience of these seasoned seamen can be put to use on training and teaching new volunteers."
 nav_dominate_bay_of_biscay_title: "Dominate the Bay of Bizkaia"
 nav_dominate_bay_of_biscay_desc: "For a long time we have rivalled the french over control for the trade that flows from and into the Bay of Bizkaia. The french merchants try to pull it towards their port city of Bordeaux, while we pull it towards Bizkaia. \nThis back and forth needs to end permanently, for any sort of faraway venture we have planned will be useless, if in the home stretch the merchants simply choose to go to Bordeaux instead. We will put all of our effort into eclipsing the french economic influence and at last, the Bay of Bizkaia shall remain, Bizkaia."
 nav_arctic_whaling_title: "Arctic Whaling Expeditions"
 nav_atlantic_whaling_outposts_title: "Atlantic Outposts"
 nav_atlantic_whaling_outposts_desc: "The discovery of the Azores Archipelago has completely changed the dynamic of our economy, and massively increased the range of our whaling expeditions. These islands sitting right in the middle of the atlantic are the perfect hub, almost as if sent by God himself so that we may tame and capture the great titans of the sea. \nNeedless to say that we will build them up, the Azores will be outfitted with state of the art docks, shipwrights and whaling stations, we will turn it into a proper atlantic service station and from here we shall launch a great whaler empire."
 nav_follow_pods_north_title: "Follow the Pods north"
 nav_follow_pods_north_desc: "For a long time the prime whaling region for our whalers was the North Sea and the Coast of Norway and Iceland. Naturally, we have sent expeditions directly north to see what we might find and we have not been disapointed. \nThe far north is home to a vast population of various species ranging from belugas, humpback's and even the ever illusive narwhal. We have also rediscovered the lost island of Greenland, a desolate land of legend that we have only heard in stories from Icelandic fishermen and it is indeed as empty and hostile as they claimed it to. The perfect place to set up a penal colony whaling station!"
 nav_follow_pods_south_title: "Follow the Pods south"
 nav_follow_pods_south_desc: "With the success of the northern expeditions the next logical step was to send expeditions south. We followed the african coast, meeting along the way the various prosperous kingdoms of West Africa and were quite impressed to see they had developed their own version of the Moor Sail. After some preliminary trading we heard from their own initial mapping efforts of various islands dotted allong the Southern Atlantic. \nSuffice it to say, we must race for them and claim them before they have a chance to do so!"
 nav_the_vasconian_lane_title: "The Vasconian Lane"
 nav_the_vasconian_lane_desc: "While we have no shortage of manpower when it comes to our whaling ventures and outposts, the same cannot be said from our other overseas investments. Various Iberian merchants have started companies and projects to take advantage of the fertile overseas lands, and sponsor the creation of cashcrops to be sold back in europe. However they haven't been able to atract Iberian workers to these plantations, owing to the nature of the work, the distance from home and the quality of the pay. A portuguese merchant however has proposed a novel solution, by contacting the Mali Empire we could tap into their monopoly over the African Slave Trade and buy slaves to work on the plantations."
 nav_antarctic_fishing_title: "The Docks of Anti-Atlas"
 nav_antarctic_fishing_desc: "Our whaling efforts seem to propell us to ever exciting frontiers. The latest one being the discovery of the southern tip of Africa. \nConsidering it's position our sailors have taken to call this rocky and mountainous cape as "Anti-Atlas" as a reference to the faraway Morrocan Atlas Mountains visible from Gibraltar. While this southern african cape is quite treacherous and dangerous, it's honestly quite nothing for seasoned and experienced Basque sailors raised in the Bay of Bizkaia. A lesser maritime culture would have quite an issue with it, probably naming it something silly like "Cape of Torments", but we aren't quite as dramatic. Cape of Anti-Atlas will do just fine." 
 nav_nautical_pioneers_title: "Nautical Pioneers"
 nav_nautical_pioneers_desc: "While we may have come late into the theater of Naval Exploration, there is no denying that our whalers, our marines and our brave admirals have been at hard at work bringing Iberia to the forefront of naval developments. We have struggled against the waves and winds, and even now we have fully dedicated ourselves, our nations very spirit towards becoming true Naval Pioneers."
 nav_basque_ocean_title: "The Basque Ocean"
 nav_basque_ocean_desc: "Our trading ventures and our mastery of the ocean currents and the wind have enabled us to truly call the Atlantic Ocean as our own. Sure, other empires may sail and build their own empires on either coastline, but once they spot our whaling and trade ships venturing against the storms they avoid, they know who this ocean truly belongs to. This is no longer the Atlantic Ocean, this is the Basque Ocean."
 nav_invest_in_whale_processing_title: "Invest in Processing"
 nav_invest_in_whale_processing_desc: "Long before our mastery over the pyrenees, Navarra was already known and famed for the quality of our iron works and smiths. As we continue to grow and expand we must not forget about this essential cornerstone of Basque economy, we must continue to invest and fund more workshops, forges and other processing facilities to refine the various ores and minerals we extract from the mountains. Only with a solid iron foundation can our realm truly prosper and resist whatever the future throws at us."
 nav_industrialize_economy_title: "Industrialize our Economy"
 nav_industrialize_economy_desc: "As the proffits of our whaling continue to grow, so do the various processing methods and industro-mechanic advancements. Be it through either savy flencers in our whaling docks, or industrious students in the university of seville, new and efficient methods of processing are being discovered and deployed all over our realm. The potential that this industrialization of our economy could bring is unimaginable, even possibly allowing our already growing whaling economy to truly skyrocket and make us even richer than our wildest dreams. The golden whale is finally within our sight."
 nav_global_whale_oil_monopoly_title: "The Basque Oil Monopoly"
 nav_global_whale_oil_monopoly_desc: "There is no words to describe our splendor. Everywhere we look, everywhere we go, no one can match our prosperity, our wealth. \nWe have grown richer than any other realm, any other empire in the history of mankind itself and we haven't even begun to peak yet. Everyday that passes, the demand for our oil increases, machines beat and hum to fuel the world's empires and they clamor and beg for our oil. In the future, gold shall become worthless, for as industry takes over the world so too shall the demand for our oil to fuel and fund it. For as long as we hold the source of the world's engines under our control, we shall be the masters of it. \nThe oil must flow."
 nav_deep_sea_expeditions_title: "Deep Sea Expeditions"
 nav_deep_sea_expeditions_desc: "Sometimes our whalers have chased their prizes far off into the deep ocean. While a dangerous venture, the reward almost always makes up for it and in the event where they are able to return, these intrepid whalers talk about virgin islands sitting quietly among the waves of the atlantic. \nSafe to say people always took these tall tales with a grain of salt, but as our whalers become more bold and new advances are made in the field of sailing, perhaps it wouldn't be a bad a idea to check on these suposed mythical islands."
 nav_federal_emperor_title: "A Federal Emperor?"
 nav_federal_emperor_desc: "Europe marvels at our splendor. At last it seems that the Iberian prosperity has reached the ears of the Holy Roman Prince-Electors, they offer us the crown and honestly, who are we to refuse? Let the reign of the Holy Roman Federation begin!"
 nav_federal_fleet_title: "The Federal Fleet"
 nav_federal_fleet_desc: "Now that we hold Iberia under our control, the time has come to upgrade our navy to reflect out status. For we no longer need a navy capable of projecting power over just Iberia, we now need a navy capable of projecting power into Europe and perhaps the world itself. \nWe will need to acess our vassal's navy, requisition whatever our admirals deem apt and decommision any old tub that is no longer fit for this new age we are bravely sailing into together."
 nav_foreign_fleetmen_title: "Foreign Fleetmen"
 nav_foreign_fleetmen_desc: "To properly maintain our ever growing navy and merchant fleet we don't only need marines, we need proper deckhands, more sailors and fleetmen. While we have been only exclusively hiring basques to man our navy, now that we have established the Iberian Federation and it's fleet there's no reason why we can't hire other Iberians to serve in it. \nWe will also open up positions of auxiliary ship fleetmen to foreigners and non-iberians, and after a set service of years aboard a ship, they will be given citizenship and the right to live in our federation."
 nav_professional_marine_force_title: "Professional Marines"
 nav_professional_marine_force_desc: "As our navy and its manpower grows, the functions of the Royal Basque Marines have been diminished, which has allowed us to truly turn the marines into a feared, organized and proffesional force. However we need more, we need to train the marines further. \nWe won't stop until the marines are able to breathe under the ocean itself!"
 nav_native_fur_trade_title: "Native Fur Trade"
 nav_native_fur_trade_desc: "As our new world whaling outposts grow, so do our meetings with the various tribes and inhabitants of these new strange lands. Their reactions to us are varied, sometimes hostile, sometimes friendly, but in the more positive outcomes it seems that some of our whalers and members of their families in the outposts have begun to engage in trading with these tribals. They offer us various foodstuffs, crafted goods but most importantly, furs. \nWhile the economic benefit of this fur trade is negligible when compared to our whaling ventures, it is a nice bonus and extra economic activity for idle workers in whaling stations. We will not hinder this native trade, If they won't harm us, we won't harm them."
 nav_state_travelers_title: "State Travellers"
 nav_state_travelers_desc: "Wheter spurned on by wanderlust, greed, or merely the wish for adventure, it seems that our youngmen are abandoning the whaling stations and leaving with native traders back into the inner wilds of the new world. Sometimes these adventurers come back, dressed in native clothing, and even more shockingly, accompanied by native wives and possibly even offspring. They bring us back wares made by the native tribes that they know our whaling stations need or would find useful, and they make a killing selling it to us, their own people! \nThese "Forest Runners" as our whalers have come to call them, are quickly outpacing and syphoning our youth away from their whaling jobs. For some reason it seems the thought of living away from society in the woods with some tribesmen, is appealing to them. \nWell we'll make our own trade monopoly! We shall invest in our own "Forest Runners" called "Forest Travellers", state sponsored workers to explicitly go into the woods and establish trade routes and deals with these native tribes for their goods, in order to dislodge the forest runners influence and tribal trade monopoly."
 nav_south_grazing_title: "Colonial Frontier Caches"
 nav_south_grazing_desc: "As we continue to expand our whaling outposts and fishing settlements, we find ourselves ever farther away from Iberia. As such, the issue of colonial supply has started to rear its head. The pampas in Southern Reisland is perhaps the solution to this problem. The land is fertile and vast, if properly tamed we could organize its agricultural output into "Frontier Caches", pre-emptive supplies that will be dropped on various islands, beaches and frontier regions. These frontier caches with their tools, and foodstuffs will enable even the most inept and inexperienced settler to survive, and perhaps even thrive, in the far off frontier."
 nav_indian_toll_title: "Indian Ocean Toll"
 nav_indian_toll_desc: "With the establishment of the Anti-Atlas shipyards, the maritime route towards rich India is now open to us. More exctingly however is the discovery of various uninhabited islands in the Indian ocean. While we never really set out with expectations to create a vast trading empire, our string of whaling outposts and stations could be easily turned and fitted with proper areas for merchants and traders. \nEven if it's not as profitable as the whale trade, perhaps it wouldn't be a bad idea to encourage our merchants to venture into india, we could even offer them support with our navy. By patrolling the Indian ocean we could make our merchants job easier, by establishing an indian ocean toll, where every merchants has to pay our ships for the right of passage in the indian ocean, while our own merchants would be exempt."
 nav_maritime_commisars_title: "Naval Commisars"
 nav_maritime_commisars_desc: "It seems that the expansion of our Marine forces has led to somewhat of a dillution in the discipline of the forces. Even worse, the Marines have developed an attitude of superiority and elitism towards their fellow shipmates and countrymen. This is a problem, not only for ship morale but also to the image and prestige of the marine force that we have strived so hard to cultivate. \nLuckily, this can be easily fixed. We will create an additional officer spot to oversee the marines, the "Naval Commisars". These aged veteran whalers, and retired captains will be given the sole authority to punish and rear any marine that strays too far from the proper attitude of a gentleman and representative of the Federations most prestigious military role. The marines will be disciplined, through any means the Commisar deams necessary."
 nav_basques_in_china_title: "Basques in China"
 nav_basques_in_china_desc: "We have stumbled into a world of wonders almost as if by accident. No, we were guided here. From our home deep in western europe, the whales have guided us here to the rich and mythical lands of China. \nLong had we wondered if the legends were true, and now that we are here everything seems to still be far greater than anything we could have dreamed off. We must take advantage of our positions and bring the rich and rare chinese goods back to europe...and to the north, it seems we met our match. The Japanese seem just as apt, just as determined and just as profficient at whaling as we are. \nBest keep an eye on them, before they can grow too ambitious and contest our monopoly."
 nav_pampas_cornucopia_title: "The Pampas Cornucopia"
 nav_pampas_cornucopia_desc: "In Southern Reisland lies a region we have taken to call "The Pampas". This region of relative flatland is not only vast but also incredibly fertile and sparsely populated by natives, making it ideal, nay, perfect to encourage immigration and settling of farmers. \nIf we are able to properly sponsor and establish an agricultural union in this land, we would not only have all of our potential food supply issues taken care of forever, we could also become a worlwide supplier of food and grain, perhaps even more productive than Egypt, Sicily or even the Blue Horde. \nWe must not let this workhorse of agriculture go away, or be taken over by anyone else, send the travellers immediately!"
 nav_global_network_title: "A Global Network"
 nav_global_network_desc: "Our great federation knowns no bounds! All across Reisland, settlements boom and prosper. \nAll thanks to the vast interconnected network of supplies and logistics that we have created for ourselves. This has benefitted Iberia propper itself as well of course, and who knows. Maybe one day the Reisland colonies will be civilized and tamed enough that we will be able to add them to our great Federation. A global federation perhaps?"
 nav_euskal_bakea_title: "Euskal Bakea"
 nav_euskal_bakea_desc: "The Basque Peace. It is how our chroniclers and historians have begun to refer to this grand period of peace that we find ourselves in. In every corner of Iberia, to faraway colonies in Reisland, to even farther whaling stations in Asia. Everyone in our great federation basks in the glory and prosperity that we have brought. Iberia is secure, and the trade lanes flow with gold, luxury goods and supplies from Reisland, truly this peace is what all true warriors strive for."
