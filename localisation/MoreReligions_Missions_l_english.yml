 #Couto Misto Missions#

 cms_harvest_season_desc: "Autumn is coming to an end, and with it the villagers bring the bounty of our free land into both their pantries and into the communal stockpile. There's a chill in the air though. A small thought, an instinct seems to have overtaken all of us and our Juiz ponders...soon enough everything will change, and we must be ready for whatever fate has in store. For now though we celebrate and party to this years hardwork. Saude!"
 cms_trinity_church_title: "The opening of Trinity Church"
 cms_trinity_church_desc: "For years we lacked a central church, but that has come to an end. Thanks to donations and volunteering from Mistelos, the aptly named Igreja da Trindade has been opened. This new structure will fullfill the spiritual needs of our peasantry. As well as serving as a rallying point and public spot for other communal uses, if need be. "
 cms_militia_commander_title: "Elect a Militia Commander"
 cms_militia_commander_desc: "Altough every peasant in couto misto is highly encouraged to own weapons and defend their own land and homes, we are in dire need of military leadership of some sort. The time has come for the peasants to come together and elect one of us to become field commander and lead the peasantry against any who dares to oppress us."
 cms_portuguese_cavaleiro_title: "Invite a Cavaleiro"
 cms_portuguese_cavaleiro_desc: "Portugal has made great advancements in war, and none is as impressive as their Cavaleiros. We'll invite one to come to Couto Misto and teach us, so that we might improve our militia. Only issue will be stopping the peasants from throwing rocks and insults at the noble born cavaleiro. Maybe offer a ham to each family as long as they swear to behave themselves...yes that works. Who doesn't like ham? "
 cms_peasant_family_connections_title: "Extended Peasant Ties"
 cms_peasant_family_connections_desc: "It's no secret that peasant families are often quite large. Being so large means that many of our own families have ties, either of blood or marriage, to other peasant families and groups spread across northwestern Iberia. We should make use of these ties to better assert our independence and spread our way of life."
 cms_basque_investment_title: "Basque Investments"
 cms_basque_investment_desc: "No realm in Iberia has become as rich as that of Navarra. The basque people are overflowing with gold, either from their goods production or from the rising profits of whaling. We could never compete with them economically, but perhaps we could strike a deal with a independent minded merchant. Guns and weapons from couto misto in exchange for a steady supply of iron, perhaps?"
 cms_popular_assembly_title: "The 313th Assembly"
 cms_popular_assembly_desc: "The time has come to convene the yearly Assembly of Couto Misto. It is when every peasant in our realm gathers together, and through popular voting we decide the focus of our resources. This year however will be special, we'll gather all of the peasantry inside the Trinity Church. Our Juiz will seat in a raised platform at the center of the church, moderating the debates and counting the votes, while below and surrounding him in a circle, will be the entire peasantry. In the house of the lord, we shall be respectful of one another and walk together in unity towards liberation."
 
 #Galician Missions#
 gal_rebellious_son_title: "Our Rebellious Son"
 gal_rebellious_son_desc: "There was a time when the Portuguese kingdom was but a mere duchy, subservient to the crown of Galicia and Leon. That was until the rebellious son of Queen Tareixa de León, Dom Afonso Henriques declared independence for his duchy. Much has changed since those times, the line of Borgoña still rules Portugal, while we have shed away from noble control. We must end the animosity between our realms, either by diplomacy or through war. "
 gal_cement_our_independence_title: "Cement our Independence"
 gal_cement_our_independence_desc: "The Leonese-Castilian civil war has given us a unique window of opportunity to once again assert our independence. Perhaps it would be wise to choose a side to aid, surely then whoever we support would be in our debt and respect our right for self determination, right?"
 gal_papal_connection_title: "Papal Connections"
 gal_papal_connection_desc: "There's no denying the influence and importance that Santiago (and Galicia by extension) has in the catholic world. Whatever may come, the bishop of Santiago will always remain an important figure both domestically and abroad. We shall make use of his religious influence and nudge the Holy See to give us the support we so rightfully deserve from our position."
 gal_renovate_santiago_title: "Renovate Santiago"
 gal_renovate_santiago_desc: "The grand cathedral of Santiago de Compostela is our greatest pride and joy. It is the beating heart of galicia, and as such we must make sure that it always reflects the splendor of our realm. We shall renovate it and make it grander than any other pilgrim destination in the christian world."
 gal_burgo_economic_oversight_title: "Dominance of the Burgos"
 gal_burgo_economic_oversight_desc: "No other group has risen to prominence in Galicia as quickly as the urban Burgos. Our economy is all but dominated by these rich merchants and craftsmen, however this doesn't need to be a bad thing. The burgos are exceptional and talented, by giving them key positions in financial matter of our government we will reap the economic rewards, while also making sure our Bishop is untroubled and untempted by the corrupting alure of gold. "
 gal_burgo_markets_title: " Burgo Street Markets"
 gal_burgo_markets_desc: "The burgo have started an initiative of popular street markets and fairs. Once a week, our city streets are flooded with various stalls and tents of merchants, farmers, peasants and craftsmen. All competing with one another trying to sell their goods to visitors, pilgrims and city natives. These weekly markets have caused an explosion of city growth and revenue, as now even peasants from the countryside flood the city, to spend the day searching for bargains and an oportunity to better their life."
 gal_militia_exercises_title: "Muster the Militias"
 gal_militia_exercises_desc: "When we achieved independence, we did so with the diplomatic power and influence of the bishop, and the resources and funding of the burgos. One of the conditions of our coexistence, is that the matters of the army are left up to the burgos control. As such instead of relying on a levy or feudal army, the burgos have organized our defense through a system of communal militias and volunteer groups. All we can do is call upon the militias, but where they go and what they do for the realms defense, will be up to the burgos."
 gal_sell_army_commision_title: "Sell Army Commisions"
 gal_sell_army_commision_desc: "Sensing yet another opportunity to make a proffit, it seems the burgos have begun to sell off the position of commander and military officers to the highest bidder. Leading the ranks of the peasant and urban militias are now either wealhty merchants seeking to make a name for themselves, or embittered nobles looking to regain any semblance of relevance or control in our realm. Surely, this can only end well."
 gal_autonomous_communities_title: "Autonomous Communities"
 gal_autonomous_communities_desc: "Back when we were a kingdom, Galicia was dotted with various autonomous communities in both cities and in rural villages. Indeed the burgos themselves came to power through these autonomous cities. Now though by Burgo decree almost every city and village is autonomous and independent. Some faraway villages in mountains and valleys are perhaps a bit...too independent. We must bring these communities back to heel and remind them that altough autonomous they are still galician!"
 gal_la_coruna_title: "A Coruña"
 gal_la_coruna_desc: "There is no disputing that Santiago is the heart of Galicia, but if it is the heart, then the Coruña is fast becoming the brain. Settled by the coast, this once small city has recently exploded in size and population, thanks to Burgo management and investment. Indeed it now even rivals even our seat of Santiago. A concerning development, or a boon to the realm we wonder."
 gal_pilgrim_trap_title: "The Pilgrim Trap"
 gal_pilgrim_trap_desc: "We can no longer deny ourselves. The allure of gold, its too much to bear. The burgos grow so rich and powerful and what do we have? The tithe? Forget the piety, forgo your fears, for we shall grow rich too! Pilgrims flood the streets of Santiago, no, they flood the country, and they are desperate for salvation and enlightment! We shall give it to them...for a price of course. Sell relics, tax the pilgrims, sell indulgences and divorce papers, put toll booths every step of the way, give them everything and take everything from them. Oh the gold, the gold! Lord forgive me...wait, I can just buy myself an indulgence!"
