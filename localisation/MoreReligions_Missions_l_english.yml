 cms_harvest_season_desc: "Autumn is coming to an end, and with it the villagers bring the bounty of our free land into both their pantries and into the communal stockpile. There's a chill in the air though. A small thought, an instinct seems to have overtaken all of us and our Juiz ponders...soon enough everything will change, and we must be ready for whatever fate has in store. For now though we celebrate and party to this years hardwork. Saude!"
 cms_trinity_church_title: "The opening of Trinity Church"
 cms_trinity_church_desc: "For years we lacked a central church, but that has come to an end. Thanks to donations and volunteering from Mistelos, the aptly named Igreja da Trindade has been opened. This new structure will fullfill the spiritual needs of our peasantry. As well as serving as a rallying point and public spot for other communal uses, if need be. "
 cms_militia_commander_title: "Elect a Militia Commander"
 cms_militia_commander_desc: "Altough every peasant in couto misto is highly encouraged to own weapons and defend their own land and homes, we are in dire need of military leadership of some sort. The time has come for the peasants to come together and elect one of us to become field commander and lead the peasantry against any who dares to oppress us."
 cms_portuguese_cavaleiro_title: "Invite a Cavaleiro"
 cms_portuguese_cavaleiro_desc: "Portugal has made great advancements in war, and none is as impressive as their Cavaleiros. We'll invite one to come to Couto Misto and teach us, so that we might improve our militia. Only issue will be stopping the peasants from throwing rocks and insults at the noble born cavaleiro. Maybe offer a ham to each family as long as they swear to behave themselves...yes that works. Who doesn't like ham? "
 cms_peasant_family_connections_title: "Extended Peasant Ties"
 cms_peasant_family_connections_desc: "It's no secret that peasant families are often quite large. Being so large means that many of our own families have ties, either of blood or marriage, to other peasant families and groups spread across northwestern Iberia. We should make use of these ties to better assert our independence and spread our way of life."
 cms_basque_investment_title: "Basque Investments"
 cms_basque_investment_desc: "No realm in Iberia has become as rich as that of Navarra. The basque people are overflowing with gold, either from their goods production or from the rising profits of whaling. We could never compete with them economically, but perhaps we could strike a deal with a independent minded merchant. Guns and weapons from couto misto in exchange for a steady supply of iron, perhaps?"
 cms_popular_assembly_title: "The 313th Assembly"
 cms_popular_assembly_desc: "The time has come to convene the yearly Assembly of Couto Misto. It is when every peasant in our realm gathers together, and through popular voting we decide the focus of our resources. This year however will be special, we'll gather all of the peasantry inside the Trinity Church. Our Juiz will seat in a raised platform at the center of the church, moderating the debates and counting the votes, while below and surrounding him in a circle, will be the entire peasantry. In the house of the lord, we shall be respectful of one another and walk together in unity towards liberation."

 #Galician Missions#
 gal_rebellious_son_title: "Our Rebellious Son"
 gal_rebellious_son_desc: "There was a time when the Portuguese kingdom was but a mere duchy, subservient to the crown of Galicia and Leon. That was until the rebellious son of Queen Tareixa de León, Dom Afonso Henriques declared independence for his duchy. Much has changed since those times, the line of Borgoña still rules Portugal, while we have shed away from noble control. We must end the animosity between our realms, either by diplomacy or through war. "
 gal_cement_our_independence_title: "Cement our Independence"
 gal_cement_our_independence_desc: "The Leonese-Castilian civil war has given us a unique window of opportunity to once again assert our independence. Perhaps it would be wise to choose a side to aid, surely then whoever we support would be in our debt and respect our right for self determination, right?"
 gal_papal_connection_title: "Papal Connections"
 gal_papal_connection_desc: "There's no denying the influence and importance that Santiago (and Galicia by extension) has in the catholic world. Whatever may come, the bishop of Santiago will always remain an important figure both domestically and abroad. We shall make use of his religious influence and nudge the Holy See to give us the support we so rightfully deserve from our position."
 gal_renovate_santiago_title: "Renovate Santiago"
 gal_renovate_santiago_desc: "The grand cathedral of Santiago de Compostela is our greatest pride and joy. It is the beating heart of galicia, and as such we must make sure that it always reflects the splendor of our realm. We shall renovate it and make it grander than any other pilgrim destination in the christian world."
 gal_burgo_economic_oversight_title: "Dominance of the Burgos"
 gal_burgo_economic_oversight_desc: "No other group has risen to prominence in Galicia as quickly as the urban Burgos. Our economy is all but dominated by these rich merchants and craftsmen, however this doesn't need to be a bad thing. The burgos are exceptional and talented, by giving them key positions in financial matter of our government we will reap the economic rewards, while also making sure our Bishop is untroubled and untempted by the corrupting alure of gold. "
 gal_burgo_markets_title: " Burgo Street Markets"
 gal_burgo_markets_desc: "The burgo have started an initiative of popular street markets and fairs. Once a week, our city streets are flooded with various stalls and tents of merchants, farmers, peasants and craftsmen. All competing with one another trying to sell their goods to visitors, pilgrims and city natives. These weekly markets have caused an explosion of city growth and revenue, as now even peasants from the countryside flood the city, to spend the day searching for bargains and an oportunity to better their life."
 gal_militia_exercises_title: "Muster the Militias"
 gal_militia_exercises_desc: "When we achieved independence, we did so with the diplomatic power and influence of the bishop, and the resources and funding of the burgos. One of the conditions of our coexistence, is that the matters of the army are left up to the burgos control. As such instead of relying on a levy or feudal army, the burgos have organized our defense through a system of communal militias and volunteer groups. All we can do is call upon the militias, but where they go and what they do for the realms defense, will be up to the burgos."
 gal_sell_army_commision_title: "Sell Army Commisions"
 gal_sell_army_commision_desc: "Sensing yet another opportunity to make a proffit, it seems the burgos have begun to sell off the position of commander and military officers to the highest bidder. Leading the ranks of the peasant and urban militias are now either wealhty merchants seeking to make a name for themselves, or embittered nobles looking to regain any semblance of relevance or control in our realm. Surely, this can only end well."
 gal_autonomous_communities_title: "Autonomous Communities"
 gal_autonomous_communities_desc: "Back when we were a kingdom, Galicia was dotted with various autonomous communities in both cities and in rural villages. Indeed the burgos themselves came to power through these autonomous cities. Now though by Burgo decree almost every city and village is autonomous and independent. Some faraway villages in mountains and valleys are perhaps a bit...too independent. We must bring these communities back to heel and remind them that altough autonomous they are still galician!"
 gal_la_coruna_title: "A Coruña"
 gal_la_coruna_desc: "There is no disputing that Santiago is the heart of Galicia, but if it is the heart, then the Coruña is fast becoming the brain. Settled by the coast, this once small city has recently exploded in size and population, thanks to Burgo management and investment. Indeed it now even rivals even our seat of Santiago. A concerning development, or a boon to the realm we wonder."
 gal_pilgrim_trap_title: "The Pilgrim Trap"
 gal_pilgrim_trap_desc: "We can no longer deny ourselves. The allure of gold, its too much to bear. The burgos grow so rich and powerful and what do we have? The tithe? Forget the piety, forgo your fears, for we shall grow rich too! Pilgrims flood the streets of Santiago, no, they flood the country, and they are desperate for salvation and enlightment! We shall give it to them...for a price of course. Sell relics, tax the pilgrims, sell indulgences and divorce papers, put toll booths every step of the way, give them everything and take everything from them. Oh the gold, the gold! Lord forgive me...wait, I can just buy myself an indulgence!"

#Navarra Missions#
 nav_galicias_son_title: "The Son of Galicia"
 nav_galicias_son_desc: "The Portuguese Kingdom has been led for almost 300 years by the House of Bourgone. This house has enjoyed a stable and clear line of sucession all the way since the Kingdom's founder "Dom Afonso Henriques I". Now however, for the first time in their history Portugal has no heir. The aging King Francisco de Borgonha only has a daughter, whom he refuses to declare as his heir on the grounds of tradition. We must take advantage of this, we will convince King Francisco to marry off his daughter to one of our cousins."
 nav_tame_fanatics_title: "Tame the Fanatics"
 nav_tame_fanatics_desc: "Now that we have dynastic control over the realm of Portugal, the time has come to pull the favors over our cousin and properly integrate Portugal into our cadre of vassals, same as Aragon and Catalonia. The fanatical armies of the Portuguese will serve us nicely in our effort towards unifying all of Iberia under a common banner."
 nav_to_santiago_title: "On the way to Santiago"
 nav_to_santiago_desc: "A union with Leon and a war with the emerging kingdom of Portugal left Galicia as a humbled vassal, until fairly recently. With the wealth of the city peasants, the burgos, and the influence of the Bishop of Santiago, Galicia has become independent again. The wealthy burgos have near complete control over the economy and the army but the bishop is not fully toothless (at least not in spirit). We will send the bishop an offer, if he accepts to become our vassal we will use our armies to crush the burgo militias and in exchange give full control over the realm of Galicia to the bishop."
 nav_asturian_legacy_title: "The Asturian Legacy"
 nav_asturian_legacy_desc: "Iberian Christendom was once united under the Kingdom of Asturias, but those times are gone. Now christian fights against christian, brother against brother and this couldn't be exemplified better than in the rivalry of Leon and Castile. Both fight and dream over holding hegemony in Iberia, a dream that is dashed by each other's continued existence. We will break up this senseless brotherly infighting, either they will both stand down peacefully, or we will march and force them to stop. Regardless, once this is done we alone will hold the legacy of Asturias. For there can be only one."
 nav_covadonga_title: "The Court of Covadonga"
 nav_covadonga_desc: "Once more Christian Iberia is unified, but not all our subjects are pleased. Grievances, feuds and rivalries continue to flare up and we need to give them an outlet for peaceful resolution. We will establish in the village of Covadonga a great legal court. This permanent court will be tasked with handling high profile cases between our realms and vassals. From now on, any disagreement in Iberia will be solved in the court and not in the battlefield."
 nav_court_hopping_title: "Iberian Courier Service"
 nav_court_hopping_desc: "Iberia is rather large, and considering the autonomy that our vassals hold, our basque diplomats are always busy hopping from one regional court to another. This system is rather ineffecient, so instead we shall establish a new "Iberian Courier Service". An instituition of dedicated regional couriers and postmen, that together with a revamp of our main roads will be able to deliver with speed and efficiency, any manner of news, letters and information from our various vassal courts in the edges of Iberia, back towards Navarra and Olito."
 nav_prepare_levy_title: "Reform the Feudal Levy"
 nav_prepare_levy_desc: ""No,no,no...this certainly won't do." King Carlos is rather upset at the state of the nations levy. For the dream of Iberia to be achieved, we will require a major reform. Away from the traditional feudal mustering, and towards the establishment of a professional, permanent fighting force. Perhaps we could contact the captains of the Navarrese Mercenary Company and ask them for help. "As good a place to start as any, I supose.""
 nav_walls_of_navarra_title: "The Royal Palace of Olite"
 nav_walls_of_navarra_desc: "Deep within Navarra, lies the city of Olite and even deeper into it, the great palace of Olite. The Palace is the center of our realm, it is where our King resides and where the Navarran cortes are established. The castle is a mastery and example of gothic architecture, with some foreign dignatiries even regarding it as something out of a fairy tale. However as beautiful as it is, the castle is in dire need of modernized defenses. \nWe will upgrade many of the outlying structures and fortifications and when we are done, our home will not only be regarded as a fairy tale dream, but also an aggressors nightmare."
 nav_aragon_reconquista_title: "The Aragonese Reconquista"
 nav_aragon_reconquista_desc: "While we are quite content with ruling over Navarra, our vassals and subjects are not so amicable to the Iberian status quo. The nobles of Aragon in particular have petitioned the King and the Cortes multiple times for their various claims over Qurtubah and Balansiya to be pressed. While normally they would have been rejected, it seems that King Carlo's recent...awakening of ambition, has led to a passionate speech before the cortes, with the King lending his support for the Aragonese. Already the newly reformed armies are being prepared, and deployed for the reconquista of Valencia by Aragon."
 nav_unleash_fanatics_title: "Unleash the Portuguese"
 nav_unleash_fanatics_desc: "No kingdom in Iberia is quite as zealous and fanatical as the Portuguese. The mere mention and thought over a holy war and conflict seems to drive them towards an insatiable bloodlust. While this could become a problem in the future for our Iberian ambitions, we are quite content and glad to simply let them loose over the Qurtubhans for now. Just to make them bleed a little bit and open their minds to more...peaceful resolutions."
 nav_show_mercy_cordoba_title: "Show mercy to Qurtubah"
 nav_show_mercy_cordoba_desc: "There is no denying the influence and strength Qurtubah holds, out of everyone in Iberia they are the only ones we would truly dare to call equals. Within the Cortes and among our vassals, there are cries and claims for us to strike them and end them for good. A war with Qurtubah would be a long, and hardous affair though. Not to mention the bad blood that would remain within Southern Iberia. \nNo, we will try another way. We will reach out for them, we will respect their customs, honor their laws and religion; and all we ask in return is for the Emir to recognize Navarra as his sovereign."
 nav_keys_of_cordoba_title: "The Keys of Qurtubah"
 nav_keys_of_cordoba_desc: "The Emir of Qurtubah met with the King of Navarra in the center of the city of Cordoba in a grand celebration. \nThe ceremony was attended by the greatest representatives from across Iberia and an audience of thousands. It started with the Emir kneeling before the King and presenting him with the keys of the city's gates. However instead of reaching for the keys, the King reached for the Emir's hand, holding both it and the keys as he pulled him upwards, and as the Emir and the King stood side by side they raised their shared handshake. Both holding onto the keys as the king yelled "Peace!" \nAfter centuries of war and devastation at last, the reconquista has ended."

 nav_integrate_catalonia_title: "Integrate Merchant Fleet"
 nav_integrate_catalonia_desc: "Now that we proven ourselves towards our Catalonian admnistrators and financeers, we have been able to negotiate a deal where we will be able to control and direct a portion of the Catalonian Merchant Fleet and use it for whatever goals the crown has in mind. Provided we pay the agreed upon subsidy, maintenance and repairs for the fleet while it's under our control...Actually, I'm starting to think we got scammed."
 nav_redirect_trade_title: "Redirect Trade to Barcelona"
 nav_redirect_trade_desc: "With the Catalonians becoming an ever increasingly important part of our government, we have found ourselves seeing their own ambitions as ours. \nAmong these Catalonian ambitions is that to control the flow of trade and riches from the mediterranean. While we aren't exactly in a position to control the wealth from Italy or Greece, we can focus our efforts towards the trade that flows into Seville and relocate the terminus towards Barcelona instead."
 nav_mozarabic_nautics_title: "Moor Sail Developments"
 nav_mozarabic_nautics_desc: "With the control and integration of Cordoba, has also come the various innovations and research that had been conducted by the muslims. Among the most promissing of all the inventions that have come out from the University of Seville has been the Moor Sail, a triangular canvas that once attached to a small or medium sized vessel, allows it unimaginable amounts of control and maneuverability over the winds. \nThis sail has the potential to enable a vessel to reliably venture into the farthest depths of the ocean and return alive! We must take use of this innovations immediatly, and fund greater developments to fit it into larger hull ships."
 nav_a_new_world_title: "A Whole New World"
 nav_a_new_world_desc: "In seaside taverns and docks, rumors and stories spread. Seasoned sailors and whalers tell stories of faraway lands across the sea, of verdant islands and cyan colored waters, of massive bounties of fish, of strange crying birds and strangers with odd vestments and languages. Already these long tales have captured the imagination of our people, and hundreds brave out into the sea to find these fabled paradises. Perhaps, just, perhaps it could be worth it to look into an investigation of our own."
 nav_terranova_title: "Terranova"
 nav_bay_of_plenty_title: "Settle the Bay of Plenty"
 nav_bay_of_plenty_desc:"The tales were true. Across the sea in a land we have called the bay of plenty, lies a stretch of ocean filled with unimaginable amounts of fish and, whales. We must establish outposts immediately, the riches of the sea lie just within our grasp!"
 nav_eel_lair_title: "The Eeel's lair"
 nav_eel_lair_desc: "A most peculiar discovery has been made by one of our whaler vessels. While on a journey from the Bay of Plenty towards the Azores, the ship travelled through an area of the Atlantic we call the "Sargassos Sea" and on it, just barely below the surface waters, a truly hellish picture revealed itself to the crew. Hundreds, no, thousands of young eels dotted the water. There were so many infact, the captain claimed the sea was more eel than it was water. Since the encounter, fishermen together with students from the University of Seville have been sent to witness the strange phenomenon and have determined that this portion of the ocean is the birthplace of every eel in the world. We must take advantage of this discovery and monopolize the eel trade."
 nav_hellish_paradise_title: "Hellish Paradise"
 nav_even_further_beyond_title: "To go even further beyond!"
 nav_even_further_beyond_desc: "We have come far from the Bay of Bizkaya, we have evolved from the mountainous Kingdom of Navarra, to a true Iberian Federation, to a grand global empire. Now we must push ourselves further. This, is to go, even further beyond!"
 nav_blue_whale_hunting_title: "A Kindred Kingdom"
 nav_blue_whale_hunting_desc: "The occean currents and winds have brought us to a strange land, but with a familiar people. The Kingdom of Hawaii is remarkable and in many aspects, very much like our own. The native hawaiian people are expert seamen, navigators and shipwrights, indeed we must admit our own whalers and marines have created a sort of affinity and kinship with these people. We must reach out for the Hawaiin king and convince him to join our great federation. We would be honored to have such a kindred kingdom, and sail brothers withint our ranks."
 nav_orca_hunting_title: "Frontier of Reality"
 nav_orca_hunting_desc: "Our people are pioneers like no other. Our whalers know no bounds, as they chase the prized whales to every corner of the world, and into the frontier of reality itself. Although the riches always find their way back to our ports, we must admit our grip and control over the farthest frontiers is quite loose. This has somehow become appealing to some within our realm, as an influx of freedom seeking adventurers now flood out into the frontier, often disappearing from the settlements into the wilds, and off of reality itself (As far as we are concerned)."

 nav_sperm_whale_hunting_desc: "From the Bay of Bizkaya, to the Bay of Plenty. From frozen Greenland, to stormy Anti-Atlas. From distant Taiwan, to even further Aotearoa. We have chased the great whale over every region and wave of this great world. Empires may claim dominion over each other and their lands, but for us, our dominion is that of the water. For wherever is a whale, there is a basque.\nThrough determination, courage and bravery we have tamed the ocean, and turned it into a whalers world."

 nav_the_vasconian_lane_desc: "While we have no shortage of manpower when it comes to our whaling ventures and outposts, the same cannot be said from our other overseas investments. Various Iberian merchants have started companies and projects to take advantage of the fertile overseas lands, and sponsor the creation of cashcrops to be sold back in europe. However they haven't been able to atract Iberian workers to these plantations, owing to the nature of the work, the distance from home and the quality of the pay. A portuguese merchant however has proposed a novel solution, by contacting the Mali Empire we could tap into their monopoly over the African Slave Trade and buy slaves to work on the plantations."

 nav_basque_ocean_desc: "Our trading ventures and our mastery of the ocean currents and the wind have enabled us to truly call the Atlantic Ocean as our own. Sure, other empires may sail and build their own empires on either coastline, but once they spot our whaling and trade ships venturing against the storms they avoid, they know who this ocean truly belongs to. This is no longer the Atlantic Ocean, this is the Basque Ocean."
 nav_invest_in_whale_processing_title: "Invest in Processing"
 nav_invest_in_whale_processing_desc: "Long before our mastery over the pyrenees, Navarra was already known and famed for the quality of our iron works and smiths. As we continue to grow and expand we must not forget about this essential cornerstone of Basque economy, we must continue to invest and fund more workshops, forges and other processing facilities to refine the various ores and minerals we extract from the mountains. Only with a solid iron foundation can our realm truly prosper and resist whatever the future throws at us."

 nav_industrialize_economy_desc: "As the proffits of our whaling continue to grow, so do the various processing methods and industro-mechanic advancements. Be it through either savy flencers in our whaling docks, or industrious students in the university of seville, new and efficient methods of processing are being discovered and deployed all over our realm. The potential that this industrialization of our economy could bring is unimaginable, even possibly allowing our already growing whaling economy to truly skyrocket and make us even richer than our wildest dreams. The golden whale is finally within our sight."
 nav_global_whale_oil_monopoly_title: "The Basque Oil Monopoly"
 nav_global_whale_oil_monopoly_desc: "There is no words to describe our splendor. Everywhere we look, everywhere we go, no one can match our prosperity, our wealth. \nWe have grown richer than any other realm, any other empire in the history of mankind itself and we haven't even begun to peak yet. Everyday that passes, the demand for our oil increases, machines beat and hum to fuel the world's empires and they clamor and beg for our oil. In the future, gold shall become worthless, for as industry takes over the world so too shall the demand for our oil to fuel and fund it. For as long as we hold the source of the world's engines under our control, we shall be the masters of it. \nThe oil must flow."

As such, the issue of colonial supply has started to rear its head. The pampas in Southern Reisland is perhaps the solution to this problem. The land is fertile and vast, if properly tamed we could organize its agricultural output into "Frontier Caches", pre-emptive supplies that will be dropped on various islands, beaches and frontier regions. These frontier caches with their tools, and foodstuffs will enable even the most inept and inexperienced settler to survive, and perhaps even thrive, in the far off frontier."
