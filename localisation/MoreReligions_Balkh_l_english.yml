 MR_balkh_flavor.1.t: "The Barlas Revolt of [GetYear]"
 MR_balkh_flavor.1.d: "The traitorous governor of Transoxiana - [TRS.Monarch.GetName] has taken up arms against us. While we were pre-occupied with the affairs of Balkh [TRS.Monarch.GetName] has secured the support of the Jalairs, Suldus, & the Arlat. Any remaining authority we might have had over the Northern territories has effectively crumbled, and they are now in open revolt against us. We must act swiftly to put an end to this revolution, lest our rule come to a premature end."

Their rule has led to regression, the people suffer while they fund their egotistical architectural projects in Balkh. The Jalairs, Suldus, and Arlat all stand behind [TRS.Monarch.GetName].\n\nThe Qara'unas have rallied their forces and fortified their positions in the South, but it's only a matter of time until their fall comes. Timur shall be avenged!"

Their rule has led to regression, the people suffer while they fund their egotistical architectural projects in Balkh. The Jalairs, Suldus, and Arlat all stand behind [TRS.Monarch.GetName].\n\nThe Qara'unas have retreated to their mountain bases and do not seem to have any intentions of preventing us from asserting our sovereignity. It seems we will have to take the fight to their doorstep..."

They are a military group formed out of garrisons stationed on the edge of the realm. They know neither ruling class nor nobility. Rulers were appointed throughout history from all different groups, and ruled by might.\n\nThe men of the Qara'unas blame the nepotism of Husayn for the decline of their order, so they won't take kindly to the throne becoming hereditary. Any prospective ruler of the Qara'unas must keep the confidence of the soldiers, lest they be replaced.\n\n\n§YNoyan Confidence§! can be earned by:\nWinning battles (§J+0.5§!)\nWinning battles with our leader commanding (§J+1§!)\nConquering Provinces (§J+0.25§!)\n\n§YNoyan Confidence§! can be lost by:\nLosing Battles (§R-0.5§!)\nLosing Battles with our leader commanding (§R-1§!)\nLosing Wars (§R-45§!)\n\n"
