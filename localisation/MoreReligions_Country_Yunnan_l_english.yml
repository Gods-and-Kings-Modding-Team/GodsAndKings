 #Yunnan Events
 MR_yunnan_flavor.1.t: "The Prince's Demands"
 MR_yunnan_flavor.1.d: "The Prince of Liang, [From.Ruler.GetName], has sent an envoy to [Root.Capital.GetName] to win us over to his side in the power struggle against the rulers in Mongolia.\n\n The envoy bears promises of wealth and a restoration of our dominion over the Tibetan plateau, should we join forces and swear fealty to the Prince of Liang, surrendering our Chinese holdings in the process."
 MR_yunnan_flavor.1.a: "His claim is just"
 MR_yunnan_flavor.1.b: "Nonsense from an upstart Warlord"
 MR_yunnan_flavor.2.t: "The Bureau submits"
 MR_yunnan_flavor.2.d: "The Xuanzheng Yuan has chosen to side with us over the Northern Pretenders. The governor-general of [XZH.Capital.GetName], [XZH.Monarch.GetName], arrived in [Root.Capital.GetName] to personally swear fealty to the Prince and offer his services. \n\nWe are now in a position to strike west and unite Tibet under the Bureau's control."
 MR_yunnan_flavor.2.a: "A wise decision"
 MR_yunnan_flavor.3.t: "The Bureau resists"
 MR_yunnan_flavor.3.d: "The Xuanzheng Yuan has spat in the face of [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s generous offer. It was foolish to extend a hand of mercy to these traitorous dogs.\n\nThe envoy returned to our court with all his teeth pulled, a clear message that they do not care for what we have to say. An attack on a nation's envoy is an attack on the nation itself, it's time to put the olive branch away and approach these fools with steel instead."
 MR_yunnan_flavor.3.a: "Traitors"
 MR_yunnan_flavor.4.t: "The Princely Guard"
 MR_yunnan_flavor.4.d: "[Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] insists on personally leading the military campaigns against our enemies. This caused quite a split in the court as the chief advisors insist on an accompanying royal guard but cannot agree on who will lead it.\n\nEmir Nizam recommends that his "crackshot" Panthay gunners lead the defense of our Prince.\n\nThe descendant of Köke Temür, Kuchlug Temür, insists that his trustworthy Naiman horsemen protect our Prince from his enemies as they did in 1363.\n\nThe final say lies with the Prince..."
 MR_yunnan_flavor.4.a: "The Emir makes a fantastic point, appoint Panthay gunners to the guard"
 MR_yunnan_flavor.4.b: "The Naiman have never failed us in their duties, appoint Naiman Cavalry to the guard"
 MR_yunnan_flavor.5.t: "The Capture of Chengdu"
 MR_yunnan_flavor.5.d: "The fall of the City of Abundance - Chengdu - at the end of a Yunnanese incursion into Sichuan has placed the final nail into the coffin of the Ming Xia ambitions.\n\nThe rage inducing memories of the siege of Kunming inflicted upon us by the vile Ming Yuzhen still burns bright in the minds of many... many who would be glad to see the capital of Xia burnt to cinders.\nThe plunder would be not only a financial gain, but also a symbolic victory against one of our greatest enemies, yet many in our court believe that it would be more productive to spare the city to endear the people to our just cause."
 MR_yunnan_flavor.5.a: "We come in peace"
 MR_yunnan_flavor.5.b: "Light your torches, actions must have consequences"
 MR_yunnan_flavor.6.t: "The Fief of Liang"
 MR_yunnan_flavor.6.d: "The fief of Liang - Bianliang - is once again under the control of our most exalted Prince, $MONARCH$. The Prince expressed a desire to move the royal court to Bianliang as he looked upon the Iron Pagoda of Youguo during a tour of the city.\n\nBianliang is strategically located on the intersection of four major canals, which would be a great asset for the logistics effort during our campaign to reconquer the Northern provinces. It would unfortunately be far less defensible than our mountainous capital in Yunnan, being situated directly on the floodplains of the fertile yellow river."
 MR_yunnan_flavor.6.a: "Bianliang will be our new seat of power"
 MR_yunnan_flavor.6.b: "$CAPITAL_CITY$ is too defensible to abandon"
 MR_yunnan_flavor.7.t: "The Fate of the False Emperor"
 MR_yunnan_flavor.7.d: "The false Emperor of Japan is now in our custody, with not a single loyal soldier left to stand between him and our ambitions. $MONARCH$ has ordered that the false Emperor remain guarded within the Imperial Palace in Kyoto while his fate is decided.\n\nMany in our court believe that the 'Emperor' should be allowed to rule over the Japanese provinces of our Chinese Empire, but not as an Emperor. There is only one Emperor and the King of Yamato must swear fealty to our exalted Emperor.\n\nMany also believe that rather than upsetting the tender & sensitive balance, it would be more appropriate to usurp the Japanese throne from within - namely by having the Emperor proclaim $MONARCH$ as his lawful heir.\n\nWe could also simply skip all pretences and execute the fool for his arrogance & resistance, but this would draw the ire of the Japanese populace."
 MR_yunnan_flavor.7.a: "There is no Emperor of Japan, he is merely a King"
 MR_yunnan_flavor.7.b: "Force him to name $MONARCH$ as his heir, then force him to retire to a monastery"
 MR_yunnan_flavor.7.c: "There can only be one Emperor, off with his head"
 MR_yunnan_flavor.8.t: "The Yuelu Academy"
 MR_yunnan_flavor.8.d: "The Yuelu Academy is one of the four great academies of classical learning within the Middle Kingdom. Located on the East Side of the namesake mountain, it has been a centre of learning and culture ever since it was opened under the reign of Emperor Taizu of the Song, producing generations of enlightened scholars.\n\nThe Academy was re-oriented under our great forefather - Kublai Khan - in order to prepare bureaucrats for their state examinations instead. With our recent aquisition, we are given a decision to make. Do we continue as the great Khan did, with intensive examinations to produce bureaucrats, or shall we look to the past and once more make it the home of scholars?"
 MR_yunnan_flavor.8.a: "Examinations are our priority, our forefathers knew best"
 MR_yunnan_flavor.8.b: "Classical studies cannot be neglected, revive the academical research"
 MR_yunnan_flavor.8.c: "Intellctual nonsense, tear it down and use it for something more useful"
 MR_yunnan_flavor.9.t: "The Capture of Pagan"
 MR_yunnan_flavor.9.d: "The walls of Pagan did not last long against our siege engines. Unlike the previous invasion of 1301, this time we came prepared, disciplined, and unified in our goals to repay the fools of Myinsaing for the humilliations they inflicted upon us.\n\nWe have been sheltering the decendants of the deposed King of Pagan - Kyawswa - for many years now. We would have a loyal & grateful ally, should we choose to return their rightful throne to them. This would also serve the dual purpose of legitimising our rule in the eyes of the people who inhabit the lands.\n\nWe could also simply raze the city to the grounds and legitimise our rule by might, rather than risking yet another Burmese betrayal. "
 MR_yunnan_flavor.9.a: "Kyawswa's kin will legitimise our control from Pagan"
 MR_yunnan_flavor.9.b: "Pillage Pagan, Burma will be ruled from [Root.Capital.GetName]"
 MR_yunnan_flavor.10.t: "Handling the Hainan Pirates"
 MR_yunnan_flavor.10.d: "Our men have finished rounding up the last of the brigands who have terrorised the people of the Southern Seas for so long. Holding cells for them have been established in Kingchow while we focus on bringing law back to this island of anarchy.\n\nIt would do wonders for our reputation and approval amongst the people, if we opt to make a public lesson of these men on the gallows. \n\nIt could be a waste to send such experienced seafarers to their death though, perhaps we could permit them to earn their freedom by training our sailors and serving in our fleets until they have repaid their debts to the realm.   "
 MR_yunnan_flavor.10.a: "No mercy for those who go against the rule of law"
 MR_yunnan_flavor.10.b: "The brigands will earn their freedom by putting their experience to use"
 MR_yunnan_flavor.11.t: "Copper Fields of [Root.GetName]"
 MR_yunnan_flavor.11.d: "Our lands in Yunnan are blessed with an abundance of copper deposits with people from Beijing to Singapura relying on our copper exports to fuel their needs. \n\nThe establishment & expansion of mines through the region has provided us with an abundance of the resource. We now have a decision to make; do we utilise the extra resources to construct more of our mighty siege bombards, or do we export it to gain a large margin of profit?"
 MR_yunnan_flavor.11.a: "Utilise it for our military"
 MR_yunnan_flavor.11.b: "Take advantage of its abundance, export it"
 MR_yunnan_flavor.12.t: "The Imperial Proclamation"
 MR_yunnan_flavor.12.d: "The people of [Root.GetName] have gathered to hear our exalted ruler $MONARCH$'s proclamation from the stairs of the royal palace. Our Empire has risen from a small rump state in the mountainous corners of the realm, and has become the forefront power in the Middle Kingdom. The Prince of Liang has proven himself to be the true successor to the mantle of Kublai, and has restored prestige & respect to the Yuan dynasty.\n\n $MONARCH$ proclaims the restoration of...."
 MR_yunnan_flavor.12.a: "Yuan. The rightful dynasty, back in control!"
 MR_yunnan_flavor.12.b: "Liang. Elevate the Princedom, we will not fail where our forefathers did!"
 MR_yunnan_flavor.13.t: "A Merchant's Gambit"
 MR_yunnan_flavor.13.d: "A Japanese merchant by the name of Yasuda Kahei has come to us with a proposal, claiming that he can be of great assistance to our cause. The affluent trader has built up a strong powerbase in Kyushu, with ties to many of the influential clergy & nobility. Should we provide financial assistance to him, he claims he could bring over many of the local power to our side.\nYasuda Kahei has also implied that were we to provide military assistance to him, he could overthrow the Shoni of Fukuoka and bring the entire region under his control.\n\nIt would be of great benefit to have an influential local on our side, and of even greater benefit if he were to find himself in control of the region..."
 MR_yunnan_flavor.13.a: "A fool's errand, order him to stay in his lane"
 MR_yunnan_flavor.13.b: "Offer him a token sum"
 MR_yunnan_flavor.13.c: "He has the full support of [Root.Monarch.GetName]"
 MR_yunnan_flavor.13.e: "Merchants cannot be trusted, relieve him of his belongings and his head"
 MR_yunnan_flavor.14.t: "Restoration of the Xuanzheng Yuan"
 MR_yunnan_flavor.14.d: "With our consolidation of the Tibetan region we are now in a position to revive the Bureau of Buddhist and Tibetan affairs, and devolve our control of the region to them. This would free up our already overstretched bureaucracy to narrow its focuses elsewhere. It may however be a better idea to rule over Tibet as we would any other province of China, assimilating them closer and safeguarding against another future secession..."
 MR_yunnan_flavor.14.a: "Restore the Bureau"
 MR_yunnan_flavor.14.b: "Tibet shall be ruled from [Root.Capital.GetName]"
