Their blazing stroke razed all, leaving fallen pillars and domes that sank into a smouldering crater. Yet the sons of survivors subsisted, humbled to mere looters, bandits and dreamers.\nA century passed, at last the rubble has been cleared and in the overgrowth of city ruins all ask: Can the Phoenix reborn?"
