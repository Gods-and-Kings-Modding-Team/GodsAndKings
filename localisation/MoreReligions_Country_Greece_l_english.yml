 GRE_ideas: "Greek Ideas"
 GRE_ideas_start: "Greek Traditions"
 GRE_ideas_bonus: "Greek Ambition"

 GRE_first: "Emerging from the Dark"

 GRE_first_desc: "Comets, crusades, civil wars, plagues, and all such manners of similar charades had been everpresent realities in the Greek homeland up until the not so distant past. In centuries of war, death, division, and suffering- the mere idea of just having a unified, strong, and peaceful state was deemed nothing more than wishful thinking, with the bleak status quo of the time having carved itself just a little too deeply in the psyche of our people.\n\nYet in spite of that; here we are, having achieved that much-desired dream and brought peace to the lands of the Greeks. The past has come and gone, and an auspicious new era now dawns- one where perhaps things can get even better for us"

 GRE_second: "A Burgeoning Identity"
 GRE_second_desc: "From the Roman to the Latin, the titles of the past have long since stopped bringing about the pride and certainty they once so fervently did. They have lost their meaning, yet in the centuries of division that followed the Fourth Crusade; we came to call ourselves a new name- Hellenes. The Roman word for the olden pagans of these lands, one that subsequent scholars and academics have since devoted their life in rehabilitating. In getting back in touch with our past- not just the Roman one- we now come to see ourselves, and our place in the world clearer than ever before"

 GRE_third: "Echoes of the Past"
 GRE_third_desc: "From Alexander's Conquests, to the great Philosophers of old, and from Great Heraclius' mighty struggles, to the tragedy of Romanos Diogenes- ours is a history known and celebrated far and wide, and one that undoubtedly helps shape the way our peers look at us today"

 GRE_fourth: "Rocks behind God's Back"
 GRE_fourth_desc: "When God first made the Earth, they say, he took great care in giving the people all that they needed in order to survive- with vast land, and good soil to tend to. When all was said and done, he took what chunks of rock and gravel there were left and threw them to the water, right behind his back. Those rocks soon came to be called Greece.\n\nOr so goes the adage, and in large part it's true; the land of this country is rough, jagged, and largely inhospitable- had our ancestors tried to work off the land alone we would all have died out long, long ago. Instead, in keeping us alive and fed; they took to the seas- and from the seas thus sprung a maritime culture older and richer than most others in this world we live in.\nThe importance of the sea for the Greek people can't quite be overstated, and the role the navy's played and keeps on playing in our state's survival is crucial one indeed"

 GRE_fifth: "Preventing Tragedy"
 GRE_fifth_desc: "Had our armies been better and our leadership more rigid, we oft like to think that the many tragedies that have struck our nation in this past millennia of its history just wouldn't have happened.\n\nIn learning a lesson from our history, we must maintain a strong military force- able to repel all manners of invaders from our lands, and to keep the tragedies of the past from happening ever again"

 GRE_sixth: "Greek Urbanisation"
 GRE_sixth_desc: "Small, and for the most part mountainous; Greece doesn't quite allow its people to spread out and get established as easily as other places do. With most of the population having always lived in a select number of cities in close proximity to the sea, and an even more select number of big market towns further inland. This, in turn has led to a noticeable degree of urbanisation within the country; with cities like Thebes, Thessalonica, Mystras, Arta and Ioannina having come to overwhelmingly surpass their immediate surroundings in population. This background, as a consequence, makes us rather good at centralising power in the cities; and in supporting those cities in enriching and enlarging themselves"

 GRE_seventh: "Empower the Epholistai"
 GRE_seventh_desc: "A powerful class of Greek shipowners, within the country and abroad; the Ephoplistai have over time grown to amass immeasurable wealth and influence, and their private fleets can oftentimes even put those of smaller nations to shame. Giving them our favor, to in turn gain theirs would most certainly benefit our state's mercantile efforts"
