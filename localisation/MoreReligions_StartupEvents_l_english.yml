 mr_startup_events.1.t: "The State of France"
 mr_startup_events.1.d.1: "Following the defeat of France at the Battle of Bouvines in 1214, the Kingdom of France was set upon a downward spiral, fragmenting its territory and vastly reducing its military prowess. Occupied with maintaining rule in Northern France, the Albigensian Crusade failed to recruit regional supporters to the cause.\nUntil recently, the Counts of Toulouse have officially professed themseleves as Catholics; however in recent years, it has come to light that [TOU.Monarch.GetName] of Toulouse has taken a serious interest in the Cathar faith. As it stands now, the County of Toulouse harbors Cathar heretics, standing firm against the Catholic Church in faithful defiance; only Swiss mercenaries have offered their services to our people.\nThe Cathar faith and its zealous adhereants find themselves with few options from this accursed world..."
 mr_startup_events.1.a: "Only time will tell what will come of the Cathars..."
 mr_startup_events.1.d.2: "Following the defeat of France at the Battle of Bouvines in 1214, the Kingdom of France was set upon a downward spiral - the Succession Crisis of 1250, the loss of the South, the slow decline of the Church - all contributions of the fragmenting of France. Now, France is no longer the military hegemon it once was - even the Kingdom itself is no longer what it once was, now an elective monarchy.\nThe King of France, though a prestigious and highly sought after title, stands atop the shoulders of the bishops who sponsor him; likewise these bishops only draw their legitimacy from the Papacy.\nDespite the apparent limited outlooks, it would only take one ambitious king to change the course of France... whoever it may be..."
 mr_startup_events.1.b: "Only time will tell what will come of the France..."   
 mr_startup_events.1.d.3: "With the central authority of the French Kingdom no longer a far reaching influence, the rulers and lords beyond Paris' sight are free to war and trade and associate as they please. In a sense, regional feudalism has returned to the country."
 mr_startup_events.1.c: "Only time will tell what will come of the us..."
 mr_startup_events.1.d.4: "With the central authority of the French Kingdom no longer a far reaching influence, the rulers and lords beyond Paris' sight are free to war and trade and associate as they please. In a sense, regional feudalism has returned to the country. But as is expected of Feudalism, we have found ourselves ruled by a foreign court, House Stuart of Scotland. Whether they can be exepected to rule Brittany fairly is anyone's guess."
 
 mr_startup_events.2.t: "After the Anarchy"
 mr_startup_events.2.d.1: "In 1253, Henry III of England defeated the forces of the Second Barons' War after a protracted war. The crackdown which followed resulted in the dismantling of English Parliament and paving the way for absolute rule in England. However, in 1283, the untimely death of Edward I, left England without a clear line of succession; resulting civil war spiraled England into a century long conflict known as the Hundred Years Anarchy.\nWhat emerged in 1383 was a powerful English monarchy at odds with the Kingdom of York, seen as illegitimate kingdom; the barons, counts, and dukes of England are quickly becoming defunct under the sole rule of The Crown; Lollard heresy now spreads throughout England, no longer within the reach Pope, whose clergy's influence have been severly hampered."
 mr_startup_events.2.a: "England is ours!"
 mr_startup_events.2.d.2: "In 1253, Henry III of England defeated the forces of the Second Barons' War after a protracted war. The crackdown which followed resulted in the dismantling of English Parliament and paving the way for absolute rule in England. However, in 1283, the untimely death of Edward I, left England without a clear line of succession; resulting civil war spiraled England into a century long conflict known as the Hundred Years Anarchy.\nWhat emerged in 1383 was a powerful English monarchy at odds with the Kingdom of York, seen as illegitimate kingdom by the English. However, it is clear that we are the true successors to the English Crown.\nOur position is weak now, beset by enemies from both the north and south, but we can lay in wait for the perfect moment to strike."
 mr_startup_events.2.d.3: "In 1253, Henry III of England defeated the forces of the Second Barons' War after a protracted war. The crackdown which followed resulted in the dismantling of English Parliament and paving the way for absolute rule in England. In 1282, Edward I of England conquered Wales placing it under military occupation by Marcher Lords. However, in 1283, the untimely death of Edward I, left England without a clear line of succession; resulting civil war spiraled England into a century long conflict known as the Hundred Years Anarchy. Druing The Hundred Years Anarchy, the Marcher Lords of Wales kept their heads down, making what they could of their lot, but also contributing little to the civil war.\nWith few men, and infighting amongst the lords, the Prince of Wales was able to sequester his court to the fortified island Angelsey..."
 mr_startup_events.2.b: "Who will come to rule Wales?"
 mr_startup_events.2.d.4: "In 1253, Henry III of England defeated the forces of the Second Barons' War after a protracted war.

However, in 1283, the untimely death of Edward I, left England without a clear line of succession; resulting civil war spiraled England into a century long conflict known as the Hundred Years Anarchy.\nThe Kingdom of Scotland has watched with great interest of the developments in The Anarchy, even taking some opurtunistic moves to expand into Cumrbia. Even when military expansion was not viable, the [SCO.Monarch.GetDynasty] line has found itself on Brittany, securing reliable loyalties even beyond Britain.\nBut with the rapid consolidation of the Southern rival, worries of future conflict begin to mount. Could an alliance with the Yorkish King prove useful?"
 mr_startup_events.2.c: "Scotland is ours!"
 mr_startup_events.2.d.5: "In 1253, Henry III of England defeated the forces of the Second Barons' War after a protracted war. The crackdown which followed resulted in the dismantling of English Parliament and paving the way for absolute rule in England. However, in 1283, the untimely death of Edward I, left England without a clear line of succession; resulting civil war spiraled England into a century long conflict known as the Hundred Years Anarchy.\nNormandy, having long historical ties with England, has once again fallen under the umbrella of the Crown of England. Ruled by the King across the Channel and with their protection could prove to prosperous, however it does prevent our own oppurtunities in mainland France..."
 mr_startup_events.2.e: "This time the English rule the Normans..."
 mr_startup_events.2.d.6: "In 1253, Henry III of England defeated the forces of the Second Barons' War after a protracted war.

 mr_startup_events.2.f: "Who knows what the future holds?"
 
 mr_startup_events.3.t: "Delicate Balance"
 mr_startup_events.3.d: "Since the election of the first Polish king as Holy Roman Emperor in 1312 the Polish Kingdom has grown rich and powerful, with the Piast dynasty becoming one of the premier great houses of Europe. Furthermore, the decree of religious freedom by Polish Emperors in 1315 inspired open heretical practice throughout Europe, a deliberate action to curb the infulence of the Church in Polish politics. This combination of political turmoil and in Western Europe and spiritual turmoil throughout christendom have made Poland a symbol of stability inspiring many minor lords and dukes to join the Empire for a semblance of order. The King in [Root.Capital.GetName] however cannot rest on his laurels; his attention is divided and forced to address the growing threats from beyond the reach of the Empire and the mounting influence of heretics within the Empire.\nWas our ambition too great?"
 mr_startup_events.3.a: "We have much work to do yet."
 
 mr_startup_events.4.t: "The Last Khan, The First Tsar"
 mr_startup_events.4.d: "In 1368, Ugechi Sartakovich was born to the Khan Talabuga Sartakovich, groomed to lead the Blue Horde alongside his brother, Chaka. By this time, Talabuga - and his predecssor Tartu Khan - had already done much to integrate themselves into the Slavic cultural tapestry. Kiev itself had risen to the great heights as when the seat of the Blue Horde was moved there in 1297; this was further bolsted with the Razing of Constantinople in 1341.\n\nBy now, Ugechi Khan has ruled for 61 years, and the age of 76, is one of the oldest rulers in Europe. During his tenure, Ugechi had ingratiated himself with the religious leaders of the Ruthenian Orthodox Church. As he grew older, the need for border raids and skirmishes in Russia lessened, only needing to stay wary of raiders from the East. A stable peace had at last arived - in Ruthenia at least. In the last decades, Ugechi has made several strides to reform the old Mongolic system of military and centralize power within Kiev. Although things are going well, it is apparent there are some detractors who only go along out of loyalty to the Khan... \n\nAs mentioned, his brother went on to be a skilled commander while Ugechi focused on ruling. Chaka soon found himself ruling over the Ilkhanate of Bulgaria, as reward for his conquests and great efficacy in fending off other hordes in the East. Chaka's ascension to Khan in 1410 placed his son as the future head of Bulgaria. Theodore, the nephew, was likewise brought up to lead armies. Instilled with the militaristic mindset and serving alongside the elite cavalry units which had come to be feared across Europe, he continues to convince his father to wrest the reins of Kiev as soon as possible. If not, he will do it himself."
 mr_startup_events.4.a: "History will look upon us fondly."
 blh_warning_tt: "§RIf the Blue Horde has not reformed from being tribal before Ugechi dies, a great disaster may befall us.§!"
 mr_startup_events.4.b: "History will be forced to remember us."
 
 mr_startup_events.6.t: "Tore Civil War"
 mr_startup_events.6.d: "In 1443 the Khan of the White Horde - Barak Khan - was assassinated. The culprit was never found, but many fingers point towards the Khan of Moghulistan, [MGH.Monarch.GetName]. [MGH.Monarch.GetName] has never concealed his ambitions to conquer the lands to the North of Balkhash. Barak's very own Beylerbey - Vakkas the Manghud - is also a suspicious figure. He has been consolidating power around his Tumens that roam the Caspian pastures.\n\nBarak's eldest son - Kerei - was confirmed as Khan shortly after his passing, but Vakkas had other plans. He brought forth claims disputing Kerei's legitimacy, rallying around the young Janibek instead with an intention to secure the throne for  him. Loyalists rallying around the lawful successor Kerei have taken up arms to protect Barak's legacy from the increasingly ambitious Manghuds.\n\nThe White horde has fallen into disunity; its fate shall be in the hands of the triumphant."

 navarra_events.19.t: "A Dream of Iberia"
 navarra_events.19.d: "King Carlos Jimenez "The Diplomat" of Navarra, has inherited an enviable position.\nFollowing the death of the Aragonese King in the Albigensian Crusade almost a century ago, the realms of Aragon and Catalonia passed onto Carlos's grandfather, Sancho Jimenez "the Strong". Ever since taking the crown at the tender age of sixteen, Carlos has shown himself to be a kind hearted and able diplomat, who has sought good relations with not only his feudal subjects but with all of his neighboring realms. In helping the matters of ruling the country has been the Navarran Cortes, made up from the feudal lords, nobility and rich men of Navarra, who remain always at the beck and call of the King's irrisistable charm.\nWhilst all is well in the pyrenee realms, the same cannot be said for Iberia or France. To the north, france remains fractured following the repeated failures to root the southern cathars who neighbor Navarra. This french failure having even led to the very recent oath of vassalage from the Monks of Bearn to Carlos, seeking his realms prosperity and protection. To the south, Iberia remains has it has been for centuries now. Fractured between the rivalring northern Christians, and the unyielding southern Muslims. Trapped forever in a vicious cycle of war, desolation and stalemate.\nFor most of his rule, Carlos has sought to disentangle his realm from both the Iberian and French chaos, seeking instead to build a more prosperous land, untouched by the horrors of war on either side of the pyrenees. This has culminated with the investment into local Basque economic activities such as whaling, and iron smelting and the trading of such goods to foreign markets in friendly french, iberian and even african realms.\nHowever, recently King Carlos has become obsessed with a strange reoccuring dream. In it he claims, he saw that it was Navarra's destiny to finally unite Iberia and end the vicious cicle of war and devastation. The King seeks now to use the full might of his diplomacy and economic prosperity, to bring the reconquista to a peaceful and harmonious end."
