 mr_startup_events.1.t: "The State of France"
 mr_startup_events.1.d.1: "Following the defeat of France at the Battle of Bouvines in 1214, the Kingdom of France was set upon a downward spiral, fragmenting its territory and vastly reducing its military prowess. Occupied with maintaining rule in Northern France, the Albigensian Crusade failed to recruit regional supporters to the cause.\nUntil recently, the Counts of Toulouse have officially professed themseleves as Catholics; however in recent years, it has come to light that [TOU.Monarch.GetName] of Toulouse has taken a serious interest in the Cathar faith. As it stands now, the County of Toulouse harbors Cathar heretics, standing firm against the Catholic Church in faithful defiance; only Swiss mercenaries have offered their services to our people.\nThe Cathar faith and its zealous adhereants find themselves with few options from this accursed world..."
 mr_startup_events.1.a: "Only time will tell what will come of the Cathars..."
 mr_startup_events.1.d.2: "Following the defeat of France at the Battle of Bouvines in 1214, the Kingdom of France was set upon a downward spiral - the Succession Crisis of 1250, the loss of the South, the slow decline of the Church - all contributions of the fragmenting of France. Now, France is no longer the military hegemon it once was - even the Kingdom itself is no longer what it once was, now an elective monarchy.\nThe King of France, though a prestigious and highly sought after title, stands atop the shoulders of the bishops who sponsor him; likewise these bishops only draw their legitimacy from the Papacy.\nDespite the apparent limited outlooks, it would only take one ambitious king to change the course of France... whoever it may be..."
 mr_startup_events.1.b: "Only time will tell what will come of the France..."   
 mr_startup_events.1.d.3: "With the central authority of the French Kingdom no longer a far reaching influence, the rulers and lords beyond Paris' sight are free to war and trade and associate as they please. In a sense, regional feudalism has returned to the country."
 mr_startup_events.1.c: "Only time will tell what will come of the us..."
 mr_startup_events.1.d.4: "With the central authority of the French Kingdom no longer a far reaching influence, the rulers and lords beyond Paris' sight are free to war and trade and associate as they please. In a sense, regional feudalism has returned to the country. But as is expected of Feudalism, we have found ourselves ruled by a foreign court, House Stuart of Scotland. Whether they can be exepected to rule Brittany fairly is anyone's guess."
 
 mr_startup_events.2.t: "After the Anarchy"
 mr_startup_events.2.d.1: "In 1253, Henry III of England defeated the forces of the Second Barons' War after a protracted war. The crackdown which followed resulted in the dismantling of English Parliament and paving the way for absolute rule in England. However, in 1283, the untimely death of Edward I, left England without a clear line of succession; resulting civil war spiraled England into a century long conflict known as the Hundred Years Anarchy.\nWhat emerged in 1383 was a powerful English monarchy at odds with the Kingdom of York, seen as illegitimate kingdom; the barons, counts, and dukes of England are quickly becoming defunct under the sole rule of The Crown; Lollard heresy now spreads throughout England, no longer within the reach Pope, whose clergy's influence have been severly hampered."
 mr_startup_events.2.a: "England is ours!"
 mr_startup_events.2.d.2: "In 1253, Henry III of England defeated the forces of the Second Barons' War after a protracted war. The crackdown which followed resulted in the dismantling of English Parliament and paving the way for absolute rule in England. However, in 1283, the untimely death of Edward I, left England without a clear line of succession; resulting civil war spiraled England into a century long conflict known as the Hundred Years Anarchy.\nWhat emerged in 1383 was a powerful English monarchy at odds with the Kingdom of York, seen as illegitimate kingdom by the English. However, it is clear that we are the true successors to the English Crown.\nOur position is weak now, beset by enemies from both the north and south, but we can lay in wait for the perfect moment to strike."
 mr_startup_events.2.d.3: "In 1253, Henry III of England defeated the forces of the Second Barons' War after a protracted war. The crackdown which followed resulted in the dismantling of English Parliament and paving the way for absolute rule in England. In 1282, Edward I of England conquered Wales placing it under military occupation by Marcher Lords. However, in 1283, the untimely death of Edward I, left England without a clear line of succession; resulting civil war spiraled England into a century long conflict known as the Hundred Years Anarchy. Druing The Hundred Years Anarchy, the Marcher Lords of Wales kept their heads down, making what they could of their lot, but also contributing little to the civil war.\nWith few men, and infighting amongst the lords, the Prince of Wales was able to sequester his court to the fortified island Angelsey..."
 mr_startup_events.2.b: "Who will come to rule Wales?"
 mr_startup_events.2.d.4: "In 1253, Henry III of England defeated the forces of the Second Barons' War after a protracted war. The crackdown which followed resulted in the dismantling of English Parliament and paving the way for absolute rule in England. However, in 1283, the untimely death of Edward I, left England without a clear line of succession; resulting civil war spiraled England into a century long conflict known as the Hundred Years Anarchy.\nThe Kingdom of Scotland has watched with great interest of the developments in The Anarchy, even taking some opurtunistic moves to expand into Cumrbia. Even when military expansion was not viable, the [SCO.Monarch.GetDynasty] line has found itself on Brittany, securing reliable loyalties even beyond Britain.\nBut with the rapid consolidation of the Southern rival, worries of future conflict begin to mount. Could an alliance with the Yorkish King prove useful?"
 mr_startup_events.2.c: "Scotland is ours!"
 mr_startup_events.2.d.5: "In 1253, Henry III of England defeated the forces of the Second Barons' War after a protracted war. The crackdown which followed resulted in the dismantling of English Parliament and paving the way for absolute rule in England. However, in 1283, the untimely death of Edward I, left England without a clear line of succession; resulting civil war spiraled England into a century long conflict known as the Hundred Years Anarchy.\nNormandy, having long historical ties with England, has once again fallen under the umbrella of the Crown of England. Ruled by the King across the Channel and with their protection could prove to prosperous, however it does prevent our own oppurtunities in mainland France..."
 mr_startup_events.2.e: "This time the English rule the Normans..."
 mr_startup_events.2.d.6: "In 1253, Henry III of England defeated the forces of the Second Barons' War after a protracted war.
