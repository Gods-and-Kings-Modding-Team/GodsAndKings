 mr_startup_events.4.d: "§RBlue Horde Content is still WIP, please play a recommended nation for the meantime§!\n\nIn 1368, Ugechi Sartakovich was born to the Khan Talabuga Sartakovich, groomed to lead the Blue Horde alongside his brother, Chaka. By this time, Talabuga - and his predecssor Tartu Khan - had already done much to integrate themselves into the Slavic cultural tapestry. Kiev itself had risen to the great heights as when the seat of the Blue Horde was moved there in 1297; this was further bolsted with the Razing of Constantinople in 1341.\n\nBy now, Ugechi Khan has ruled for 61 years, and the age of 76, is one of the oldest rulers in Europe. During his tenure, Ugechi had ingratiated himself with the religious leaders of the Ruthenian Orthodox Church. As he grew older, the need for border raids and skirmishes in Russia lessened, only needing to stay wary of raiders from the East. A stable peace had at last arived - in Ruthenia at least. In the last decades, Ugechi has made several strides to reform the old Mongolic system of military and centralize power within Kiev. Although things are going well, it is apparent there are some detractors who only go along out of loyalty to the Khan... \n\nAs mentioned, his brother went on to be a skilled commander while Ugechi focused on ruling. Chaka soon found himself ruling over the Ilkhanate of Bulgaria, as reward for his conquests and great efficacy in fending off other hordes in the East. Chaka's ascension to Khan in 1410 placed his son as the future head of Bulgaria. Theodore, the nephew, was likewise brought up to lead armies. Instilled with the militaristic mindset and serving alongside the elite cavalry units which had come to be feared across Europe, he continues to convince his father to wrest the reins of Kiev as soon as possible.

 mr_startup_events.7.d: "The Ulus of Chagatai used to stretch from Bukhara in the West to Turfan in the East, but that was not to last. In 1346 - Amir Qazaghan - the leader of the influential Qara'unas Mongols, overthrew Qazan Khan and replaced him with his own puppet. As this happened, the Dughlats in the East seceeded from the Ulus, placing their own Chagataiyid Khan on the throne of Moghulistan at Almalik - Tughlugh Tomur.\n\nTughlugh Tomur asserted himself in the East, and brought a unified fighting force to the gates of Mavarannahr to reunify the Chagataiyid realm. Following his conquest he placed the young but ambitious Timur of the Barlas in charge of administrating Transoxiana. This arrangement worked well at first, but the Moghul Khan desired further centralisation and sent his son Bayar to serve as governer, executing many of the local Amirs in the process. Timur & the grandson of Qazaghan - Husayn of the Qara'unas - united the Amirs of Mavarannahr and successfully pushed the Moghuls out of the West, killing Bayar in the process. This came at the cost of heavy casualties to the Barlas during the battle at Qarshi.\n\nFollowing this, Husayn & Timur co-ruled the realm, dividing it alongside the South & North. Timur's ambition was not satiated by this, and he sought the sole rulership of the realm. Due to the losses suffered during the counter-attack against the Moghuls, he lacked the sufficient forces to secure the loyalty of the Jalairs & Suldus. When Amir Husayn caught wind of Timur's plot, he had him jailed and killed.\n\nThe leader of the Qara'unas sits on his throne from the jewel of Balkh, reconstructed by his father. He has zero interest in rulership however, and opts instead to indulge himself from his mountain palace. The grandson of Timur - Iskandar Mirza - governs the Northern cities on behalf of the Qara'unas. On the surface he co-operates, but he secretly harbours plans to overthrow the Qara'unas and rehabilitate the legacy of his grandfather."

 mr_startup_events.8.d: "King Carlos Jimenez "The Diplomat" of Navarra, has inherited an enviable position.\nFollowing the death of the Aragonese King in the Albigensian Crusade almost a century ago, the realms of Aragon and Catalonia passed onto Carlos's grandfather, Sancho Jimenez "the Strong". Ever since taking the crown at the tender age of sixteen, Carlos has shown himself to be a kind hearted and able diplomat, who has sought good relations with not only his feudal subjects but with all of his neighboring realms. In helping the matters of ruling the country has been the Navarran Cortes, made up from the feudal lords, nobility and rich men of Navarra, who remain always at the beck and call of the King's irrisistable charm.\nWhilst all is well in the pyrenee realms, the same cannot be said for Iberia or France. To the north, france remains fractured following the repeated failures to root the southern cathars who neighbor Navarra. This french failure having even led to the very recent oath of vassalage from the Monks of Bearn to Carlos, seeking his realms prosperity and protection. To the south, Iberia remains has it has been for centuries now. Fractured between the rivalring northern Christians, and the unyielding southern Muslims. Trapped forever in a vicious cycle of war, desolation and stalemate.\nFor most of his rule, Carlos has sought to disentangle his realm from both the Iberian and French chaos, seeking instead to build a more prosperous land, untouched by the horrors of war on either side of the pyrenees. This has culminated with the investment into local Basque economic activities such as whaling, and iron smelting and the trading of such goods to foreign markets in friendly french, iberian and even african realms.\nHowever, recently King Carlos has become obsessed with a strange reoccuring dream. In it he claims, he saw that it was Navarra's destiny to finally unite Iberia and end the vicious cicle of war and devastation. The King seeks now to use the full might of his diplomacy and economic prosperity, to bring the reconquista to a peaceful and harmonious end."

The Svinfellingars have operated with de facto independence in the Eastern territories, but the rest of the Farthings have remained staunchly loyal to the Asbirningars.\n\nAt first the clergy was packed with puppets of the Asbirningars, but that all changed when Guodmundur Arason - the Bishop of Hólar - began consolidating power around the clergy independent from the Althing. In the years since the Icelandic clergy have grown tremendously in size, possessing a larger army than all the Gothis combined. This is in no small part due to the patronage of the Norwegian King, who wishes to assert himself over the Icelandic crown through the clergy.\n\nEdvard Larsson - The Bishop of Skalholt - has begun marching on [ICE.Capital.GetName] with clear intentions to overthrow the Althing.

 mr_startup_events.10.d: "Outremer has been in a state of uneasy peace since 1429, the last major conflict with the Mameluke Sultanate. The Grand Vizier, Barsbai, led a large force to besiege Aleppo, and the forces of Antioch were powerless to do more than cower behind the walls of the city while the Prince's host circled the Mameluke camp at a nervous distance and harassed their supply lines. Eventually, however, Bohemond VIII was able to convince Fulk III of Tripoli to join him. In a rare show of solidarity, a force of the fearsome Edessan cavalry arrived without warning to join the crusader host a week after an explosion of cholera in the Mameluke camp. Having made insufficient progress against Aleppo's defenses, Barsbai chose to cut his losses and return home. The Mamelukes retreated in good order, and the Latins were unable to achieve anything more than continuing to harry them and steal a small amount of baggage before breaking off the pursuit near Homs, but all claimed a great victory over the Saracens, though only the Edessans truly profitted from the endeavor as they cut a plundering swath home up the Euphrates. \n\nNow, it is 15 years later and all the Princes warily await the next Mameluke incursion, which very well could be the last.

 mr_startup_events.13.d.1: "In the fallout of the Latin Succession Crisis of the late 14th Century, the lands of the old emperor lay divided. The crisis stemmed from the young heir of the Latins, John II of Constantinople, came to power after his father died in a series of Bulgar raids. The Montferrat dynasty of Thessalonica attempted to overturn the young noble, instead offering their own Reginald Montferrat to take over the Empire. This march on Adrianople ended with the disastrous Battle of the Rhodope in 1401, where the Montferrat armies were driven back, but John II's army faced severe casualties. At the same time, the march on the southern states by the Montferrat had initial success in Athens and the Negroponte, but were repelled by the Sgurus dynasty at the Acrocorinth. This internal conflict led to a recent succession crisis of their own, as the death of the head of the Montferrat line in Thessalonica led to a split between brothers in 1436, the states of Thessaly and Thessalonica each seeking to dominate the other. At this, the Athenian parliament convened and decreed that they shall be independent from the squabbling princes in Thessaly. \n\nThus, the Empire was divided - the Montferrat in Thessalonica and Thessaly, the heirs of Baldwin in Adrianople, and the remaining scattered states of the Frankokratia remain locked in conflict. They all seek to reconvene, combining their lands and restoring Latin rule of the Rhomania, but to do so will require just as much luck as clever strategy and brave soldiers. For when Knights and Swords falter, only the will of God can make the impossible occur."
 mr_startup_events.13.d.2: "In the fallout of the Latin Succession Crisis of the late 14th Century, the lands of the old emperor lay divided. For the despots of southern Greece, they saw this not as a tragedy, but as an opportunity. They had long chafed under Latin rule; since the fall of the Angelos Dynasty, the state had become increasingly Western, pushing the Hellenes to the side in favor of promoting their Catholic power. Despots saw this as an affront, and with the words of Georgios Plethon in their ears, they saw themselves not as heirs to Rome - but heirs to an older identity, and older group - the Hellenic world of Plato and Socrates, of the ancients that came before. During the collapse, the first to rebel were those in the Peloponnese, Morea, Achaea, and Corinth. At first there was conflict, but when Thessalonica sent troops to reclaim the isle, the Defense of the Acrocorinth was staffed by soldiers from across the isle. When the siege ended, and the Latin Knights were driven off, the Corinthian defenders stood strong.\n\nIn the intervening years, the despots and republics aligned themselves with Corinth, forming the League of Corinth, including both Latin and Hellenic states. In the north, a band of Albanian tribes headed by the generals of the Kantakouzenos family united the region, conquering Epirus to form a new power in the north east. Despite their proposed unity, the League has internal squabbles. If they should solve them, their power could unite the entire region - but should it falter, the legacy of the Hellenes could be lost forever..."
 mr_startup_events.13.d.3: "The city of Istinople was not always the desolate ghost town that it is nowadays. In the past, it was the pearl of the entire east, the shining jewel on the crown of the Byzantine Emperors. But several key events occurred that destroyed the once great metropolis. A great meteor crashed from the sky in 1197, destroying sections of the walls and “cursing” the Angelos dynasty. In 1204, during the Fourth Crusade, large sections of the city were looted or set to the torch, causing significant damage and weakening the importance of the great palaces. But the real devastation came during Hulegu's sack in 1260 - there, the citizens were slaughtered, their homes ransacked and looted, the great dome of Hagia Sophia cracked and collapsed from the flames, and the last of the royal Byzantine bloodline trampled by Mongol hooves.\n\nIn the aftermath, the city was abandoned. There was too much wreckage, too many bodies, and too little funds to properly rebuild the town. But a few came afterwards. Greek merchants that settled and established trade links across the hellespont. When the Thracians went to secure the city in the aftermath of the civil war, they called upon the family of the Franopolous to lead and guide the city as their stewards before they were brought into the fold. But the ambition of the Franopolous is mighty - they have a great greed in their eyes and hearts, a dream to unite and dominate all of the lands of the Romans under their heel, to reject the humiliation they have sustained by both Hellene and Latin alike. They will restore the Byzantine glory - through blood, iron, and God, they will restore it."
