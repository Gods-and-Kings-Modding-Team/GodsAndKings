 string_start_title_great_song:1 "The Radiant Empire of §YGreat Song§!"
 string_start_great_song:1 "The current "restoration" of the former dynasty of §YSong§! dates to 1355, when the son of prominent Red Turban rebel Han Shantong, §YHan Lin'er§! was declared the §YLongfeng Emperor§! by his general Liu Futong. The young emperor, beloved by the Red Turban cause, was nicknamed the "Little Lord of Light" by his followers. The backbone of Lin'er's public support was the cult of the §YWhite Lotus§!, a religious movement based on a syncretic and millenarian blend of Maitreyan Buddhist and Manichaean beliefs. The Song emperor and his successors represent both a restoration of Chinese rule after humiliating subjection to Mongol rule and a divine incarnation of the §YMaitreya Buddha§!, who will guide his followers to enlightenment in these dark times.\n\nIn reality, however, the fate of Great Song has been less brilliant than was prophesised. Though §YYuan§! forces were in disarray and unable to put a stop to the revolts gripping the country, the unabated disputes between regional warlords rising to fill power vacuums have prevented Great Song from achieving its aims of Chinese unification. Han Lin'er's young age, lack of military experience and immense symbolic importance led to him becoming the pawn of powerful warlords such as §YLiu Futong§!, §YZhu Yuanzhang§!, and, ultimately, §YZhang Shicheng§!.\n\nThe union of Shicheng's §YKingdom of Wu§! and §YGreat Song§! enabled by his guardianship over the emperor established the new entity as the premier power of the wealthy south of China, but Shicheng's lack of ambition and Lin'er's inability to assert his own power facilitated the consolidation of Chen Youliang's state of §YGreat Han§! in the north of China, which now bars any hope of easy reunifcation of the Middle Kingdom.\n\nDecades later, the stalemate between north and south has settled into the same rough equilibrium that defined the pre-Yuan era. Both §YHan§! and §YSong§! claim sole authority as inheritors of the Mandate of Heaven, but Han's lack of material resources and Song's weak governmental apparatus conspire with the natural border of the Yangtze to create inertia on both sides.\n\nNow, however, Liu Futong, Zhu Yuanzhang, and Zhang Shicheng are all long dead. As the north continues to recover from decades of devastation and the descendents of Chen Youliang hungrily eye the south, this may be the §YKing of Light's§! final chance to assert his own authority, bring true unity to his cause, and achieve what has never been possible before - reunifcation from the south." 
 string_start_title_great_han:1 "The Empire of §YGreat Han§!"
 string_start_great_han:1 "Few have profited more successfuly from the collapse of the §YYuan§! than the §YHan§!. The current dynasty, though adopting the same name as the ancient and glorious Han dynasty, was founded by the fisherman-turned-rebel §YChen Youliang§! in 1360. Despite his humble origins, he was able to quickly ascend the ranks of the Red Turban leadership and carve out a realm along the Yangtze, eventually declaring himself the §YDayi Emperor of Great Han§! and the passing of the §YMandate of Heaven§! from Mongol hands.\n\nThough united in hostility towards the Yuan, Chen's own ambition and ambivalence towards the spiritual claims of the so-called §YKing of Light and Emperor of Song, Han Lin'er§!, led to constant and bloody conflict from the outset of their respective rules. Ever the pragmatist, after several fruitless conflicts in Jiangxi and Anhui against the Song and their allies, Chen turned his attention instead to driving out the fragile Yuan remnants and building up a strong base of power on the North China plains. In this he and his successors have largely been successful, as Mongol rule is now curtailed to the fringes of civilisation in Manchuria, Yunnan, Tibet and Mongolia itself.\n\nThis policy has not come without costs. Hostility with the §YSong§! has never ceased, and in the long campaigns for the north key cities once held by Han such as §YWuchang§!, once Chen Youliang's base of operations, have been allowed to fall into Song hands. The North China plains have been secured, but what was once the heart of the Chinese world was rendered a pale shadow by centuries of Liao, Jin, and Yuan exploitation followed by decades of chaos in the rebellions which followed. While the Song can continue to build on the relative prosperity of the south developed under their namesake dynasty, only briefly interrupted by Mongol rule, Han must pursue a more thorough economic and demographic revitalisation.\n\nThe continued threat posed by various neighbours of Han - the §YTibetans§!, §YJurchens§!, but especially the §YMongols§! and pretenders in §YXia§! and §YSong§! - have inevitably led to a constant need for military funding and organisation. The dynasty's answer to both its need for large mobile armies and a web of loyalists in a relatively new political establishment has been to empower princes with considerable local authority and military command.\n\nThis has been both a boon and a source of deep anxiety in the upper echelons of the court. While the consolidation of administrative and military power in the princes has deterred any serious attempt to penetrate Han borders and made the position of the Chen clan effectively unassailable by political outsiders, the threat of §Yusurpation by members of the imperial clan§! is perhaps the greatest fear of any sitting Han emperor.\n\nWhile most princes enjoy a great deal of freedom in their own fiefdoms, some such as the §YPrince of Chu, Hong Chen§!, are so powerful that they operate effectively autonomously, wielding private armies which can rival even that of the central government and administrating their provinces with little oversight, much to the chagrin of court-appointed officials. Empowering the princes has entrenched the power of Han and the ruling clan, but failure to adapt this ad-hoc system of governance §Ycould well lead to future disaster...§!"
 string_start_title_ming_xia:1 "The Kingdom of §YMing Xia§!"
 string_start_ming_xia:1 "The state of §YMing Xia§! officially claims the §YMandate of Heaven§!, just as the neighbouring and much larger states of §YSong§! and §YHan§!. Despite his grandiose claims to empire, the so-called emperor of Xia has little support beyond the Shu region and is widely considered little more than a regional strongman by the wider political community.\n\nThe current Xia state is named for its founder, §YMing Yuzhen§!, a Red Turban rebel who declared himself the §YTiantong Emperor§!, the founder of a new imperial order. Failure has blighted the new state since its inception, with Yuzhen himself soundly defeated by the Yuan holdout in §YYunnan§! led by the §YPrince of Liang, Bolud Temür§! in 1363.\n\nSince then, Xia has ceased all attempts at outward expansion and struggles to maintain its own independence only by courting the two titans of §YSong§! and §YHan§! and making use of the defensible terrain of Sichuan to deter aggression from the deadlocked powers. Yuzhen's successor, the §YKaixi Emperor Ming Sheng§! was able to maintain the independence of Xia for the duration of his 42 year reign but dare not attempt any outward expansion, and the dynasty very nearly met its end when his incompetent successor, §YLi Ming§!, was deposed by court factions after only 3 years on the throne and replaced by his younger brother §YGaoxu Ming§!.\n\nFortunately for the Xia, Gaoxu has not been the weak puppet his courtiers expected, and was able to outmaneuver internal factions and avoid external invasion through shrewd diplomacy. The reign of Gaoxu has been marked by internal pragmatism and stability, but the ongoing insularity of the Xia regime continues to cast a long shadow over its hopes of ever securing true power over its claimed domain - §Ythe entirety of China§!." 
 string_start_mali_GK:1 "In the Year 1311, the §YMansa Muhammad ibn Qu§! of the §YMalian Empire§! great set sail across the Atlantic Ocean to try and find what lay beyond the horizon. However, the storms blew their fleet off course, eventually landing them in a chain of islands with beautiful green capes that they would call §YBinkenedugu§!. Repairing their ships and returning to the empire, an upstart §YMusa Keita§! had attempted to seize power while remaining as the acting regent. He refused to step down, and so led a short-lived rebellion in the city of Niani before eventually being cut down in 1312.\n\nThe early reign of §YMansa Muhammad II§!, son of §YMuhammad ibn Qu§!, was one of consolidation and stabilization. He spent the empire’s considerable wealth frugally, building up schools and mosques while dealing with potential threats to his rule through negotiations and peace. However, his rule was undercut when peace talks broke down between his younger brother, §YMansa Magha§!, who overthrew him with the support of the §YGbara§! and several local territories in 1340. §YMuhammad II§! would spend the next three years rebuilding his army to defeat §YMagha§!, reclaiming the throne in 1343, but it was not to last. By 1348, his nephew, §YMansa Mahmud Magha§! succeeded his father and removed his uncle once and for all. While he reclaimed many territories lost and improved the state of the royal treasury, this era would be remembered as one of strife and chaos.\n\nWhen he passed in 1390, it was his cousin §YMansa Abu Bakr II§!, the grandson of §YAbu Bakr I§!, who took power. He reclaimed the cities of Gao, Tekrur, and Timbuktu as vassals to the crown, and reaffirmed Jolof as an ally to the crown. His son §YMansa Abu Bakr III§! claimed the throne of Mali in 1413, and has ruled since. While Mali faced some struggles in the latter 14th Century, their power remains unquestioned in the Sahel, both in trade, military, and scholarly learning. In the year 1444, §YAbu Bakr III§! looks towards the west, into the horizon, just as §YMuhammad ibn Qu§! did so long ago. He wishes to reclaim lost territory, strengthen his realm, and explore the vast ocean."
