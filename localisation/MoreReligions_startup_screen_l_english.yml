 string_start_great_song:1 "The current "restoration" of the former dynasty of §YSong§! dates to 1355, when the son of prominent Red Turban rebel Han Shantong, §YHan Lin'er§! was declared the §YLongfeng emperor§! by his general Liu Futong. The young emperor, beloved by the Red Turban cause, was nicknamed the "Little Lord of Light" by his followers. The backbone of Lin'er's public support was the cult of the §YWhite Lotus§!, a religious movement based on a syncretic and millenarian blend of Maitreyan Buddhist and Manichaean beliefs. The Song emperor and his successors represent both a restoration of Chinese rule after humiliating subjection to Mongol rule and a divine incarnation of the §YMaitreya Buddha§!, who will guide his followers to enlightenment in these dark times.\n\nIn reality, however, the fate of Great Song has been less brilliant than was prophesised. Though §YYuan§! forces were in disarray and unable to put a stop to the revolts gripping the country, the unabated disputes between regional warlords rising to fill power vacuums have prevented Great Song from achieving its aims of Chinese unification. Han Lin'er's young age, lack of military experience and immense symbolic importance led to him becoming the pawn of powerful warlords such as §YLiu Futong§!, §YZhu Yuanzhang§!, and, ultimately, §YZhang Shicheng§!.\n\nThe union of Shicheng's §YKingdom of Wu§! and §YGreat Song§! enabled by his guardianship over the emperor established the new entity as the premier power of the wealthy south of China, but Shicheng's lack of ambition and Lin'er's inability to assert his own power facilitated the consolidation of Chen Youliang's state of §YGreat Han§! in the north of China, which now bars any hope of easy reunifcation of the Middle Kingdom.\n\nDecades later, the stalemate between north and south has settled into the same rough equilibrium that defined the pre-Yuan era. Both §YHan§! and §YSong§! claim sole authority as inheritors of the Mandate of Heaven, but Han's lack of material resources and Song's weak governmental apparatus conspire with the natural border of the Yangtze to create inertia on both sides.\n\nNow, however, Liu Futong, Zhu Yuanzhang, and Zhang Shicheng are all long dead. As the north continues to recover from decades of devastation and the descendents of Chen Youliang hungrily eye the south, this may be the §YKing of Light's§! final chance to assert his own authority, bring true unity to his cause, and achieve what has never been possible before - reunifcation from the south."
