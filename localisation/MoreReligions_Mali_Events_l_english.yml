 mr_MaliFlavor.1.t: "The Second Great Journey"
 mr_MaliFlavor.1.d: "The previous night had been quite the terror. Between the fierce winds and crashing waves, few Malian sailors could sleep peacefully, let alone those manning the sails and steering the mighty vessel. Yet that was not what kept them awake at night. What kept their eyes wide, what kept their stomachs churning, what made them nearly giddy with excitement was what they saw two days prior - Gulls, flying overhead. They were close. So, so very close.\n\nThe next day, the dawn broke. When each sailor rose from their cot they approached the bow of the ship. There, in the distance, they could see it, piercing above the waves. Land. Trees, much like those of the southern Temne lands, stretch over the sandy beaches. As they cried out in joy, these Colonists pressed further until they touched down upon the shores of this new land. They didn’t know it, but they were to become some of the first old world explorers since the vikings of old to actually settle on this new land. They sent one of their ships back, returning for more supplies as they established a camp.\n\nThe Mansa was overjoyed. The new continent had been finally reached by their hands, not just explored and mapped on a page. In a short decree, the Mansa diverted several thousand shells towards this project - their legacy would be one of exploration, colonization, and the discovery of the west."

mr_MaliFlavor.1.a: "Send more colonists to chart out nearby settlements!"
mr_MaliFlavor.1.b: "All of our support must go to the new settlement!"
mr_maliflavor.1.event_insight: "§GEvent Insight:§!\n\nThis event will detail our voyage to the new world, and give us the option of improvince our current colony or expanding it to province nearby."

mr_MaliFlavor.2.t: "The Importation of Sugar"
mr_MaliFlavor.2.d: "Sugar is not native to this new land in the far west. Nor is it native to our homeland, either. It originated from a far eastern land, where the climate is warm and the rains are plentiful. However, this new island of Hayti seems to be a place where we can reasonable grow this crop. We shall take this valuable good and establish our own holding of it in the new world, so that we can dominate the Reisland Trade."
mr_MaliFlavor.2.a: "Bring in the Foreign Sugar Cane!"
mr_MaliFlavor.2.b: "Bring in the Domestic Sugar Cane!"
mr_MaliFlavor.2.c: "Perhaps another time."

mr_MaliFlavor.3.t: "The Binkenedugu Dispute"
mr_MaliFlavor.3.d: "The isle of Binkenedugu was dicovered by the Malian Mansa, Mohammad ibn Qu in the mid 14th Century. But, despite calling the islands lush and green, they never properly settled these lands. Our own sailors, eager to explore this new land, set off on their own. When they settled the islands in 1414, there was some diplomatic grumblings from the Keita line, but we smoothed it over with clever words and charming smiles. Now, they claim ownership over these isles in their ever expansive push to the west. They cite Qu's voyages as a reason, of which they do have some argument, but we remain stedfast in our claim as well. In the end, the Princes of the confederation met and discussed what to do next, and..."

mr_MaliFlavor.3.a: "The isles shall become theirs."
mr_MaliFlavor.3.b: "Their claim holds no merit! Begone!"

mr_MaliFlavor.4.t: "The Princes Respond"
mr_MaliFlavor.4.d: "A breatheless courtier runs into the great Mansa's chambers. Barely able to speak, he bows before relaying the message that the princes deliberated over for days."
mr_MaliFlavor.4.a: "They agreed? A wonderful response!"
mr_MaliFlavor.4.b: "They refuse!? Such insolence!"
gain_ability_to_diplo_vassalize_jolof: "We shall gain the ability to diplomatically make @JOL Jolof a §YFarma§!"
gain_ability_to_declare_war_for_farma: "We will gain the §YEstablish Farma§! Casus Belli on @JOL Jolof."


mr_MaliFlavor.5.t: "The Farma of Jolof"
mr_MaliFlavor.5.d: "We have recieved a notification from the Mansa of Mali, and quite the shocking one at that. They believe that our relationship of alliance is not suitable enough - they protect us from outside harm and supply us with merchants and traders, so it is far more applicable to call us a territory in their empire. This is not exactly an uncommon thought, and many of our nobles agree that we would fair better against the changing world underneath Malian protection. However, some princes reject this notion, claiming our sovereignty to their dying breath. We must make a decision, lest the Mansa grows impatient."
mr_MaliFlavor.5.a: "Together, we shall see a beautiful new dawn."
mr_MaliFlavor.5.b: "They must be mad. If they want our land, they can come and take it!"

mr_MaliFlavor.6.t: "The Fate of the Confederation"
mr_MaliFlavor.6.d: "We knew our proposal would be audatious. We were asking a confederation of several princes in Jolof to all bend the knee to us in subjugation, to give up their rights and privileges as rulers to be underneath us. However, we also knew that we had every right to press this claim. We are far larger, far more powerful, and far more influential in their secret court meetings than they think. So when our demand was sent, we patiently waited a response. When the messenger arrived, his face was calm - he clearly rehearsed what he was about to say."
mr_MaliFlavor.6.a: "The Confederation shall join the Empire!"
mr_MaliFlavor.6.b: "The fools dare refuse? Time to end this Confederation!"

mr_MaliFlavor.7.t: "A New Land Discovered!"
mr_MaliFlavor.7.d: "Spurred by the great Mohammad Qu's voyages to Binkenedugu, our Mansa [Root.Monarch.GetName] has decided to launch his own mission to the far west of the world. Utilizing Cordoban ship designs with sailors from the Jolof and Futa Jallon region, these great vessels sailed beyond the currents of the cape, reaching the far west in a matter of months. There, they discovered great forests of green, filled with strange and foreign creatures and people alike. They didn't have supplies to remain, so they returned back with a few captives and trinkets - but that was enough to light the fire of discovery within the Mansa's heart. He ordered new journeys, another great mission filled with gold and farmers, to establish a permanent base in these new colonies. The Malian Age of Exploration has begun!"
mr_MaliFlavor.7.a: "The world just became much larger..."
